  <h1>Apple is a Hardware Second Company</h1>
  <time datetime=2019-01-07T00:00:00-0500 class="post-date">Mon, Jan 7, 2019</time>
  <p>You don&rsquo;t need to look hard to find the holes in this Emperor&rsquo;s clothes. Apple has been heading downhill for a couple of years, but it&rsquo;s only recently that the public at large started to take notice.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Two good articles last week, one by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silver-lining-apples-very-bad-iphone-news/">Brian Barett</a> in Wired and the other by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/technology/apple-iphone-replacement-mom.html">Kevin Roose</a> in the NYT. Both explain the issue behind Apple&rsquo;s disappointing sales are closer to home than what Tim Cook would like us to think: consumers don&rsquo;t rush in to buy expensive new iPhones when their older ones are almost just as capable and work fine. &ldquo; &lsquo;It used to be that for $650, you got all new features, a better screen, everything,&rdquo; &rsquo; says one tech analyst in the Times&rsquo; article. Now iPhone cost at least $100 more (and the cost goes up easily since you need to purchase a case and a calbe for your laptop) for anything that new.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more going on than just smarter customers and humdrum technology from Apple, and you don&rsquo;t need to go digging to find the issue. Tim Cook is basically <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">saying</a> it himself: Apple is a services company now. Tech pundits including famed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples%5Fterrible%5Fno%5Fgood%5Fvery%5Fbad%5Fearnings%5Fwarning">John Gruber</a> agree.</p>

<p>But While Cook and Gruber believe in the &ldquo;services first&rdquo; future for Apple, the public is starting to digest the &ldquo;hardware is second&rdquo; present. Apple&rsquo;s hardware is mediocre at best, easily comparable with other leading tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Samsung. And, like these companies, Apple&rsquo;s products are prone to defects that are highlighted by Cook&rsquo;s more apologetic (and, I believe, increasingly frightened) reactions. The era of &ldquo;You&rsquo;re holding it wrong&rdquo; is over.</p>

<p>Apple used to be untouchable in its innovative software <em>and</em> hardware quality. Today the only thing that seem to remain is a hefty price tag.</p>
