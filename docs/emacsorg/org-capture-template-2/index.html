  <h1>My Org Capture Templates - Part 2</h1>
  <time datetime=2019-01-21T00:00:00-0500 class="post-date">2019-01-21... 



 </time>
  <p>I was happy to see part one of this series generated interest on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/agxe8n/my%5Forgmode%5Ftemplates%5Fpart%5Fone%5Fany%5Finterest%5Fin%5Fmore/">Reddit</a>. One of the things I love about Org-mode (and Emacs) is this passion among its user and the thirst to learn more from each other. I believe one of the major reasons for that is Org-mode&rsquo;s complexity: there are so many options, it <em>has</em> to be personalized by its users&rsquo; needs. Org-mode is esaily the most personal tool I&rsquo;ve used in a while. Every time I read something Org-mode related somewhere else it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m invited over for a discussion over a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Speaking of personal, today I&rsquo;m going to discuss my Journal capture template. I hope you enjoy, and as always, comments are welcome on Reddit (follow me using the links above) at least until I integrate a commenting system on this site.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-the-journal-template">Part 2 - The Journal template</h2>

<p>First, here&rsquo;s the code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal&quot; entry
  (file+datetree &quot;~/Documents/Personal/journal.org&quot;)

  &quot;**** %U%?%a \n&quot; :tree-type week)
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>For key-press &ldquo;j&rdquo; initiate &ldquo;Journal&rdquo; template, which as follows:</li>
<li>Go to <code>~/Documents/Personal/journal.org</code> and create a <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html#DOCF82">dateree</a> entry there</li>
<li>Create a sub header (level 4) under the day header, under the week header, under the year header (a function of datetree, see link above).</li>
<li>Enter an inactive timestamp, place cursor right after it, place a link to file you were just in.</li>
<li>New line</li>
<li>Make this a <em>weekly</em> datetree (the default is a monthly datetree)</li>
<li>Finish</li>
</ol>

<p>I prefer a weekly format in my journal over a monthly format. In fact, the week is a &ldquo;productivity unit&rdquo; which always made sense to me, and this mindset integrates beautifully into Org-mode. In my archive folder, which you saw in part 1, each week has its own <code>.org</code> file (from 1 to 50 something). I don&rsquo;t really need this to make Org-mode work, but there&rsquo;s something assuring in viewing the folder and seeing all the week files.</p>

<p>The reason the timestamp and the link are condensed together (no space) is because I delete most of the timestamp and just leave the hour. This way the cursor is where I need to start erasing the timestamp from. I haven&rsquo;t found a way yet to create an hourly timestamp only and I don&rsquo;t want to forget to put in the hour, so this is the best solution for now. Why is the hour important? First, personal preference from the past, where I would write the time and the location for each entry. Second, this helps me see a couple of entries in the journal that are about the same event (the title is just the name of the event on my agenda) so that if a certain event is developing and I&rsquo;ve journaled about it a couple of times, I can easily see the hour of each entry as a separator.</p>

<p>Finally, I use a link to connect me back to <code>w[##].org</code> file (week number of the year, as I mentioned above) from which I created the journal entry. In my weekly org files, the incidents or events themselves contain very little details, usually only what is my next action (next thing to do) and a logbook drawer containing the times I worked on a task if I keep track. If I want to discuss something, I create a journal entry for it. I always prefer to leave my thoughts and conclusions in a personal space, separate from the more generic org file which also contains work-related material. The link takes me back to that event or incident, and because the name is the same as the event, I know exactly what I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>

<p>My journal is another feature of Org-mode that fits my workflow effortlessly. The notion that I keep entries around events rather than just a daily or a semi-daily habit works well and behooves me to write my thoughts down often. At the same time the journal file is kept in a personal folder that is not synced to my work VM. I use TRAMP inside my work VM&rsquo;s capture template, so when I want to capture something in my journal from work, I&rsquo;m prompted to log into my file server with a password, without saving anything at work.</p>

<p>This privacy barrier may sound cumbersome, but once working, I almost never have to tweak with it. This kind of privacy and separation of my personal files from the cloud help me sleep better at night.</p>
