  <p>17:42. Almost time to go home. I&rsquo;ve been trying to hold on a bit longer, to tell myself I should around more before I buy it. Elite is complex, with a steep learning and no real objectives in sight. I was worried it&rsquo;ll be more work after work. So of course, I bought it.</p>

  <p>News that surfaced last week report of a <a href="https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/">security flaw</a> that exists in the most popular password managers out there like LastPass, KeePass, and 1Password among others. Does this mean people should stop using them? No. Will people use this news as yet another excuse not to use password managers? Sure.</p>

  <p>At work, we are a small team serving a very large gorup of clients. Because of that, automation is very importnat. It is impossible to get to each client directly, and we constantly have our plates full with other projects, walk-ins and general maintanance.</p>

<p>One project that was recently brought up was detecting and replacing old company-owned Macs that are out of warranty and cannot be upgraded to Apple&rsquo;s newest macOS, which at the time of this writing is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828">macOS Mojavi (10.14)</a>. the idea is to locate these machines and retire them. To do such projects, we use system managment tool, KACE. KACE used to belong to Dell, and is still mostly used for Windows machines (it is most usefuls on Dells, obviously) but in this line of work it&rsquo;s many times using the tools you already have.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve been using LastPass for the last 5 years and been happy with it. I recommended it to friends, family, and co-workers. I tried to sell it through its convenience: once set up, LastPass auto-fills user and password fields, and can even log you into a website directly. LastPass also creates complicated passwords automatically and is available on every major browser, iPhones and Android.</p>

<p>But it seems like even LastPass&rsquo;s time has come.</p>

  <p>I took a long unplanned break from writing about my Templates because of the <a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/blogging/css-updates-1/">CSS changes</a> I worked on and the complications with Magit. I&rsquo;m happy to say these are now behind me, and that I gained another grain of confidence using Magit and knowing git, but this is a post for yet another time.</p>

<p>Since the last two templates are rather short, I&rsquo;m putting them both here together. Here we go:</p>

  <p>I was happy to see part one of this series generated interest on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/agxe8n/my%5Forgmode%5Ftemplates%5Fpart%5Fone%5Fany%5Finterest%5Fin%5Fmore/">Reddit</a>. One of the things I love about Org-mode (and Emacs) is this passion among its user and the thirst to learn more from each other. I believe one of the major reasons for that is Org-mode&rsquo;s complexity: there are so many options, it <em>has</em> to be personalized by its users&rsquo; needs. Org-mode is esaily the most personal tool I&rsquo;ve used in a while. Every time I read something Org-mode related somewhere else it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m invited over for a discussion over a cup of coffee.</p>

I was happy to reply and figured it would be intesting to dig into my capture templates. I started writing this post explaining all of my templates, but then realized I&rsquo;m starting to edit out details because the post is getting too long. So instead, I&rsquo;m going to explain each template at a time. Hopefully you find this interesting!</p>

  <p>Even though it doesn&rsquo;t show on this blog (yet), I&rsquo;ve been blogging since I got into college, more than a decade ago. Blogging is an activity that combines a couple of passions for me: writing, technology. and visual creativity. My process hasn&rsquo;t changed much over the years, and the tools I taught myself to use help me maintaining my routine. This is a quick explanation of its main components.</p>

  <p>When someone asks what we install on their personal devices (BYOD laptops), I usually give them the abridged version. People rarely care about details. Every now and then though, someone is a bit concerned and asks for more information. Stuff like why do we need software that tells us details about their hardware, how do we use it, and of course, if we can view their personal data. My answer to that last question is &ldquo;we can if we want to.&rdquo; It bothers me this question comes only from so few individuals.</p>

  <p>PayPal informed me that the host of my WordPress blog is charging me for another $80 or so for the next year. The very next day, tumblr <a href="https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231885248-Sensitive-content">decided to shoot itself in the head</a> (rather than the leg, if you ask me). It was good to be reminded to not trust cloud services for creative content - like my blog.</p>

  <p>Having a consisted, stable server for my org files has been on my mind for a while. I bought a Raspberry PI (RP) to serve as a file server to be used as a &ldquo;hub&rdquo; that will always be on and host these files. This is a description of the setup of what I&rsquo;ve done to make this work. I hope you&rsquo;d find this useful! Feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>
