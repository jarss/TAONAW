  <p>This is my first attempt at explaining a full (though simple) script I wrote. This is also the longest post I&rsquo;ve ever written.</p>

<p>I always say I&rsquo;m no programmer (or scripter). Despite that, I somehow ended up creating a couple of useful scripts on my Linux machine.</p>

<p>My elementray scripts are a dynamic work in progress. I keep tweaking them as I learn and create new ones. I&rsquo;d love to hear from experienced scripters just as I&rsquo;d love to hear from those of you who never opened Nano before. Feedback is always welcome.</p>

  I&rsquo;ve kept a journal (though infrequently) since my early 20s. A thick notebook with a table of contents on its first two pages made of a long list of dates. At the time, life was too chaotic to keep the habit uninterrupted. I&rsquo;m not sure at what point I converted to digital form, but I flirted with digital journaling for years before it became my primary method of keeping a journal.

  <p>Macs are evil. Macs are expensive pieces of toy hardware, which is often not up to par with what&rsquo;s offered on the market (my personal biggest annoyances are the keyboards and the touchpad). Everything you do on a Mac you can do on Linux better&hellip; and so on. If that&rsquo;s true, why are so many professionals in IT environments (which are otherwise Windows-based) use Macs? I want to see if my perspective changed.</p>

  <p><a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/org-capture-in-files/">In my last post</a>, I discussed how I (finally) found out that I can use entire org files as capture templates. This is a basic feature that works out of the box, but the org-mode manual doesn&rsquo;t give it enough exposure in my opinion. Turns out it <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8161">wasn&rsquo;t just me</a> either.</p>

<p>As I was expanding my checklists and learning more &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; org-capture features, I discovered more useful things, but ran out of time to write about them. It&rsquo;s now time to get back to more &ldquo;basics&rdquo; of org-capture again for some helpful tips.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy org-mode-ly speaking. There is a lot to say, and as I was writing my post, more ideas occurred to me that behooved me to stop writing and experiment more, which lead to more interesting results, which meant I ran out of time to write about the results. When I finally returned to my post this morning, I realized there&rsquo;s so much to explain, I can&rsquo;t include it all in one go. Here you go, part one of my latest adventure in org-mode: org-capture from org files.</p>

  <p>Even though I don&rsquo;t have any means of tracking how many readers I have on this blog, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a little bit responsible for my audience. This is an attempt to see how a quick &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up&rdquo; post while the blog is otherwise idle.</p>

<p>So, a few quick updates about what&rsquo;s coming up:</p>

  <p>Says <a href="https://www.jamierubin.net/2019/06/13/writing-in-the-digital-age-an-introduction/#comments">Jamie T. Rubin</a>: &ldquo;As a writer, I naturally want to spend my time writing. More and more I see tools getting in the way of writing. If that wasn’t the case, why do so many tools now add a “focus” or “distraction-free” mode? What choices can I make to simplify my writing ecosystem?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My answer to that, considering the theme of this blog and how I&rsquo;m writing it,  is obvious. But the question is going deeper than that, and so should be the answer.</p>

Instead of describing my workflow again or just praising Orgzly&rsquo;s usefulness in a repeated manner, I thought it would be interesting to reach out to its creator and ask a couple of questions instead. To my delight, he was happy to reply! I&rsquo;m happy to present my first interview on this blog.</p>

  <p>Every now and then I discover (or re-discover) a tool in Linux that does exactly what I need it to do. Some examples include ffmpeg, to shrink down my self-recorded webcam journal session while increasing the volume; abcde, to rip a classical music CD to flac and find its exact title and name; youtube-dl, which downloads any video online I need along with aria to speed these downloads, and more.</p>

<p>Today I want to praise a new excellent tool, this time for screenshots: <a href="https://flameshot.js.org/#/">Flameshot</a>.</p>

  I&rsquo;ve been using Linux as my daily driver for the last three years. I work with Windows on a daily basis and I support Mac issues all the time, but I don&rsquo;t think I will ever go back to using either one for my personal data. As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s Linux which made an appearance at work: without my VM and Org-mode, I would probably be drowning under hips of emails, meeting invites, support tickets, and the constant in-person walk-ins into our work environment.

At first, I thought it was because setting the time and following through the guide was too much of a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; in my head to tackle, so I broke it down. Then, as I looked at the individual components, I realized it&rsquo;s more complicated then technicalities alone.</p>

  <p>A few years back, I was an avid user of Evernote. That was a period of information &ldquo;innocence&rdquo; for me, before I knew much about Linux and switched careers to IT. Back then, Evernote was an amazing discovery. It was the first serious digital (and, to be honest, analog as well) system I built. I remember many nights where I drifted off to sleep thinking about how to tag and achieve my information in it. To this day I have plenty of memories stored away in its achieve files &ndash; though they have been since downloaded and converted from the App&rsquo;s native format.</p>

  <p>I recently tried <a href="https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el">Org-Gcal</a> a second time just to turn it off again. I was following the (now slightly outdated) <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-26-gcal/">instructions</a> on <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/">Mike Zamansky&rsquo;s</a> blog and managed to get it working this time, but I found the end result messy and cumbersome. This is mostly because of how I use org and my agenda to quickly get a view of what I need, not really a reflection on the tool itself. It made me understand how different the methodology of Google calendar and Org-mode are.</p>

  <p>I always dislike it when I read a post explaining why there&rsquo;s been a break in posting. It&rsquo;s usually a sign that the next post will be the last if it will happen at all, and it&rsquo;s always some excuse about being busy, life getting in the way, etc. etc. So I guess now it&rsquo;s my turn to write one of these posts.</p>

  <p>17:42. Almost time to go home. I&rsquo;ve been trying to hold on a bit longer, to tell myself I should around more before I buy it. Elite is complex, with a steep learning and no real objectives in sight. I was worried it&rsquo;ll be more work after work. So of course, I bought it.</p>

  <p>News that surfaced last week report of a <a href="https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/">security flaw</a> that exists in the most popular password managers out there like LastPass, KeePass, and 1Password among others. Does this mean people should stop using them? No. Will people use this news as yet another excuse not to use password managers? Sure.</p>

  <p>At work, we are a small team serving a very large gorup of clients. Because of that, automation is very importnat. It is impossible to get to each client directly, and we constantly have our plates full with other projects, walk-ins and general maintanance.</p>

<p>One project that was recently brought up was detecting and replacing old company-owned Macs that are out of warranty and cannot be upgraded to Apple&rsquo;s newest macOS, which at the time of this writing is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828">macOS Mojavi (10.14)</a>. the idea is to locate these machines and retire them. To do such projects, we use system managment tool, KACE. KACE used to belong to Dell, and is still mostly used for Windows machines (it is most usefuls on Dells, obviously) but in this line of work it&rsquo;s many times using the tools you already have.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve been using LastPass for the last 5 years and been happy with it. I recommended it to friends, family, and co-workers. I tried to sell it through its convenience: once set up, LastPass auto-fills user and password fields, and can even log you into a website directly. LastPass also creates complicated passwords automatically and is available on every major browser, iPhones and Android.</p>

<p>But it seems like even LastPass&rsquo;s time has come.</p>

<p>Since the last two templates are rather short, I&rsquo;m putting them both here together. Here we go:</p>

  <p>I was happy to see part one of this series generated interest on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/agxe8n/my%5Forgmode%5Ftemplates%5Fpart%5Fone%5Fany%5Finterest%5Fin%5Fmore/">Reddit</a>. One of the things I love about Org-mode (and Emacs) is this passion among its user and the thirst to learn more from each other. I believe one of the major reasons for that is Org-mode&rsquo;s complexity: there are so many options, it <em>has</em> to be personalized by its users&rsquo; needs. Org-mode is esaily the most personal tool I&rsquo;ve used in a while. Every time I read something Org-mode related somewhere else it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m invited over for a discussion over a cup of coffee.</p>

I was happy to reply and figured it would be intesting to dig into my capture templates. I started writing this post explaining all of my templates, but then realized I&rsquo;m starting to edit out details because the post is getting too long. So instead, I&rsquo;m going to explain each template at a time. Hopefully you find this interesting!</p>

  <p>Even though it doesn&rsquo;t show on this blog (yet), I&rsquo;ve been blogging since I got into college, more than a decade ago. Blogging is an activity that combines a couple of passions for me: writing, technology. and visual creativity. My process hasn&rsquo;t changed much over the years, and the tools I taught myself to use help me maintaining my routine. This is a quick explanation of its main components.</p>

  <p>When someone asks what we install on their personal devices (BYOD laptops), I usually give them the abridged version. People rarely care about details. Every now and then though, someone is a bit concerned and asks for more information. Stuff like why do we need software that tells us details about their hardware, how do we use it, and of course, if we can view their personal data. My answer to that last question is &ldquo;we can if we want to.&rdquo; It bothers me this question comes only from so few individuals.</p>

  <p>PayPal informed me that the host of my WordPress blog is charging me for another $80 or so for the next year.

  <p>Having a consisted, stable server for my org files has been on my mind for a while. I bought a Raspberry PI (RP) to serve as a file server to be used as a &ldquo;hub&rdquo; that will always be on and host these files. This is a description of the setup of what I&rsquo;ve done to make this work. I hope you&rsquo;d find this useful! Feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>

  <p>In his 5th Emacs podcast, <a href="https://emacscast.org/episode%5F5/">Rakhim</a> discusses the difficulties of windows management in Emacs. I agree with him. Emacs&rsquo; Windows are a pain.

  I used to write all my tasks, personal and work, into one tasks.org file.
On Sunday night, this was good. I had 5 tasks on my list, and I was ready to start my work week. But it didn&rsquo;t take long (two days actually) for tasks.org to become monster.org. It didn&rsquo;t happen because of the number of tasks, which I kept (more or less) under control. It happened because of the size of the projects I was working on.

  When I write, I live in Emacs (with the awesome Solorized theme) inside Org-Mode.
With time, I found that Org has already made me more effienet writer and note taker. I write notes in every meeting now, rather it&rsquo;s my &ldquo;turn&rdquo; or not. I write notes as I work, about every solution and every problem I&rsquo;m facing. I write first thing in the morning, usually about org-related thoughts I had as I wake up, over a cup of Sumatra cofee (little almond milk, one pack of sugar).
