<p></p>

<p>When it was time to build a base on my second attempt at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnautica">Subnautica</a>, I picked a location near the <a href="http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Blood%5FKelp%5FZone">Blood Kelp Zone</a>. Its cliff walls spread in front of me into the endless blue, and deep down I could see the pale <a href="http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Bloodvine">bloodvines</a> reaching up toward me like the claws of a forgotten demon. As if by cue, scary dramatic music started playing, and my PDA&rsquo;s AI announced that the zone &ldquo;matches 7 of the 9 preconditions for stimulating terror in humans.&rdquo; I was thankful the game creators didn&rsquo;t include the two other ones, whatever these may be.</p>

<p>The reason I chose this location for my home was because of fear. Subnautica is a game about fear, and it was teaching me to face it one step at a time. The first time I played, the game had the element of surprise. I remember my first <a href="http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper%5FLeviathan">reaper</a>: it came out of nowhere and grabbed my <a href="http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Seamoth">Seamoth</a> like a plaything. I  yelped, slammed the Alt+F4 keys, and stomped out of my room white like the hallway wall I was leaning against, mumbling &ldquo;oh my god&rdquo; over and over. Now I know better. I know where they are, I can see them in the distance, and&hellip; I&rsquo;m still scared. But I go ahead anyway. The fear is not pushing me away; it&rsquo;s teaching me to be prepared. The only thing that&rsquo;s really scary is fear itself.</p>

<p>Now, the base is furnished complete with a <a href="http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Moonpool">Moonpool</a> for my Seamoth which I call &ldquo;Discovery.&rdquo; It is powered by a nuclear reactor I built from fractions retrieved from brave explorations. A single glass corridor connects my living area to a bubble-like observatory room which hovers directly over the dark abyss. There&rsquo;s a chair in the middle of that observatory, so I can sit and read my PDA&rsquo;s contents while staring fear in the face.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found something at the bottom of the abyss. &ldquo;Something that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a dark, green-hellish looking place with bones of creatures the size of an apartment building. Each day I explore further. Each day I push further and the game never fails to scare me. Winning these small battles against myself bit by bit becomes addictive. I look back at what scared me before and I know I&rsquo;ve conquered it. I know that now if one of these monsters chooses to attack my base, I will fight it. The base hanging over the cliff that once terrorized me is now my home, transformed into my new comfort zone. I know every fold in the ground, every floaters-covered rock, every hole to the mushroom cave. You can&rsquo;t be scared of what you know. Subnautica is an excellent teacher of this lesson.</p>
