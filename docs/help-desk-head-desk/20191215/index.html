 <p>I haven'tt picked up my camera for more than a week, and I was itching to take
photos. It's a feeling  I've known since I could remember feelings. A mix of
unrest and uncertinty, much like a dog circuling around the house before a
walk is necessary. Well, a walk was necessary.</p>
<p>The weather was an inivting misty gray. The sort of day when rain hasn't fully
gave up to the fog, threatening in little needles; nothing like the
golden hour recommended in tutorials. In fact, it was mid-day with the sun
nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>I aimed for Fort Tryon. Familiar grounds, and in a weather like that, I was
hoping for less humans and more animals. Most of all, I wanted the sort of
quiet you learn to pray for in NYC. Being out of practice, I was stuck in my
head thinking about my latest computer-related issue<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It was the quiet, now that I think about it. Turning into a side street
muffeled the contstant car &ldquo;woosh&rdquo; sounds and horns out of my mind. The street
lead to a nicer part of the nighborhood, and a building I passed many times
before was shrowded in fog to my left. A tree stood naked in the driveway,
covering  some of the windows with dark zigzagging branches; a car was parked
diagnally, implying the owner of the car was probably also the owner of the
place, or someone</p>
