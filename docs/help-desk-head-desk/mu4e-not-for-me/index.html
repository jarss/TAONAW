    / <a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/tags/email/"> email</a>
</time>
 <p>I had <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8004">irreal&rsquo;s post</a> about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bfsck6/mu4e%5Ffor%5Fdummies/">mu4e for dummies</a> on my todo list for a week before I decided to give it up. At first, I thought it was because setting the time and following through the guide was too much of a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; in my head to tackle, so I broke it down. Then, as I looked at the individual components, I realized it&rsquo;s more complicated then technicalities alone.</p>
<p>Org-mode has resolved an old problem for me I didn&rsquo;t know I have. Or, more precisely, I didn&rsquo;t know it was a problem because it was too big to grasp. It was the issue of identities and online accounts.</p>
<p>Emails are a good way to explain this issue. I currently have four active email accounts: my main Gmail one which is used for professional needs, financials, keeping in touch with family, etc. Then I have another Gmail account, which in the past was more specific for other endeavors such as creative writing and close friends. This became a more personal account which is now associated with my calendar. A third active account is my work email, in Outlook, which is probably the main account I&rsquo;d like to use within Org-mode. I also have an account with proton mail, which I try to utilize more often with my GitHub and other techy things I do as I try to break away from the Google hold over my life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably starting to see the issue here, and it doesn&rsquo;t really have to do with Emacs or mu4e.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t instead to have four active email accounts, but this is how it is. While it&rsquo;s possible that others have no more than two email accounts which might fall into nice buckets of &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and &ldquo;work,&rdquo; for me, these buckets happen within Org-mode. This is why it&rsquo;s such a critical part of my organization. Life is chaos. My job bleeds into my personal life. My technological passions bleed into work. I <em>need</em> the barrier between emails and calendar for my Org-agenda, which contains <em>everything</em> I want to do. Once I decide to put something on my agenda, it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore where it came from. What matters is that it gets done. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
