 <p>Over the time I&rsquo;ve been using org-mode, a natural process of project management has emerged. For the first time in my adult life, I haven&rsquo;t felt the need to switch systems of productivity. I even enjoy looking at my projects nowadays, a list of organized notes, tasks, and information. I&rsquo;ve discussed projects here before, but not in this detail. I hope this would be beneficial to others, especially those new to org-mode.</p>
<p>This system is rather simple and straight forward, without many bells and whistles. To understand it though, I need to first discuss my methodology in org-mode.</p>
<p>Most tasks are created in one of two ways: through a capture template on my desktop (either at home or at work), or through a tap on the &ldquo;+&rdquo; on my <a href="http://www.orgzly.com/help">Orgzly widget</a> on my phone. I&rsquo;ve discussed both of these a couple of times on my blog under the <a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/tags/orgmode/">org-mode tag</a>.</p>
<p>A task is usually nothing more than a quick reminder (&ldquo;pick up clothes from the dry cleaner&rdquo;). Sometimes, especially at work, a task can become more complex: (&ldquo;Create a consistent guest user-template on office iMac&rdquo;) which then develops sub-tasks (&ldquo;Auto-launch Safari: ticket creation page&rdquo;) and (&ldquo;log user out within 5 minutes of inactivity&rdquo;) and (&ldquo;Keep same wallpaper for all guest log-ins&rdquo;).</p>
<p>When this happens, my method is to switch the first task&rsquo;s <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Workflow-states.html#Workflow-states">Keyword</a> (which is now the parent task) from <code>TODO</code> to <code>ACTIVE</code>  and remove the &ldquo;Scheduled&rdquo; property. Then, I create a sub-task under it (&ldquo;Auto-launch Safari: ticket creation page&rdquo;) and <em>that</em> sub-tasks gets its own &ldquo;Scheduled&rdquo; property.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks like laid out:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d notice I use agenda-visible timestamps to express the duration of the project as I work on it. This also means that the project will show at the top of my agenda <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I see my in-progress big projects first. When all sub-tasks are done for the projects, I mark the parent task as DONE and move on.</p>
<p>large projects, ones that can end up taking weeks and months, are too big to fit in my <a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/agenda-multiple-files/">weekly org file</a>. Thankfully I don&rsquo;t have too many such projects <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. When such a large project takes place, I do two additional things. First, I create an independent org file for the project. Second, I create a &ldquo;Log&rdquo; sub-tree at the very top of the project, before all the other TODOs, which is used as a journal for that project. The log sub-tree is broken down by non-agenda timestamps and brief titles, explaining my thoughts and methods as I work through the project. I also take a second look at the title of the project, which is often just the very first task that started it, and change it to &ldquo;OP: &hellip;&rdquo; something. I find that calling a large project something like &ldquo;OP: iMac walk-ins terminator&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Create a consistent guest user-template on office iMac&rdquo; is more memorable and just plain fun.</p>
<p>While I have an active journal file, I find that more and more I gravitate toward breaking off journal &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; into respective projects I&rsquo;m working on. This is faster (my thoughts about the project are right there, not in a separate journal that needs to be linked correctly) and easier to retrieve later (instead of thinking &ldquo;what was it that I did&hellip;&rdquo; staring at a large journal thinking what to search for, I have a project with related thoughts).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a clear-cut requirement of switching from multi-level tasks to a full project, nor a point where I switch from writing in my generic journal to starting a log in a specific project, but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a mix of how much time I&rsquo;ve worked on something (is it been a few weeks? Do I keep getting back to it?) and how complex it is.</p>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes:</h2>

<p>This is done with <code>(setq org-sort-agenda-notime-is-late nil)</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is more a state of mind than a technical limitation. I don&rsquo;t like having large projects weighing down on my agenda because these often get stuck as I wait on other people and little progress is made. If I&rsquo;m absolutely sure I need to have such a project up (for example, if we&rsquo;re working on a large-scale migration at work), I try to adjust the timestamps on my agenda so I don&rsquo;t see the project all the time and rather have a sub-task as a reminder to check in on something again. I find that it&rsquo;s often better mentally to have a clear agenda, knowing that I have a task set to check-in on something within 24 or 48 hours than to constantly see all my TODOs stuck in red at the top. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
