 <p>When I started researching privacy more seriously, I didn&rsquo;t know what I was looking at is the face of a forlorn, desolate path that seems to go nowhere. I picked it up as a challenge, and within a few days, it became clear that privacy is, unfortunately, a journey of hard sacrifices to make.</p>
<p>I asked for help on Reddit&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/">privacy community</a> and I was blocked from posting because my freshly-created account specifically for this purpose was too suspicious. It was just one stop of many I&rsquo;ve made in the last two months. Article after article from Medium to Lifehacker was filled with begginer tips like &ldquo;use VPN,&rdquo; or &ldquo;search with Duck Duck Go.&rdquo; As I kept digging deeper, looking for more specifics and advanced techniques, the more it seemed that the internet I use every day suddenly had an end. A wall.</p>

<p>Everything on the screen had a dictated sense of purpose. I was supposed to follow the &ldquo;good&rdquo; answers laid in front of me: buy a visa gift card with your credit card; submit your phone number to get a discount; surrender your verified email address to chat with an agent. Not a single website gave additional options. Everywhere I looked, I had to give up a piece of my privacy or to lie and hope for the best. I chose the latter option whenever I could. The feeling that I&rsquo;m doing something wrong intensified.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the loneliness. I haven&rsquo;t logged into Facebook for years, living with most of my friends and past co-workers behind. I&rsquo;ve stopped using Twitter last year, and with it, I stopped following trends and celebrities in my industry. Most recently, I stopped using Instagram and lost touch with those who liked my photos, a window to the outside world especially during the pandemic. On the other hand, getting in touch with me became more difficult since I insist on less popular apps that no one wants to download. When I try to explain why, it often feels like I&rsquo;m speaking a different language even with those close to me the most.</p>
<p>This seems to be the price for privacy. I am almost at a breaking point and I&rsquo;ve only started. I understand now why there so little <em>real</em> information about true privacy: Those who stay out of the familiar platforms live in the shadows by default. It&rsquo;s not that they try to hide, they just do what they can do to not to sell their lives away, which means they can&rsquo;t reach us or we them. You can&rsquo;t Google them up, friend them on Facebook, Follow them on Twitter&hellip; So they don&rsquo;t exist to us, automatically-suspected criminal of the dark web.</p>
<p>So much of what we do, what we <em>are</em>, is not even ours to share but instead borrowed, hosted somewhere unknown to us, supplied only if we sign an agreement to give it up. And we don&rsquo;t care to know. After all, when was the last time you read Facebook&rsquo;s TOS? Twitter&rsquo;s? Gmail&rsquo;s? Apple&rsquo;s? Instagram&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you this is all just a cheap Matrix ripoff. I wish I could go see a therapist who&rsquo;d assure me I&rsquo;m exaggerating. The problem is is that I <em>am</em> better. I can&rsquo;t unlearn what I&rsquo;ve learned, unread what I&rsquo;ve read. Instead, I&rsquo;m figuring out how to bend the rules just enough to be more than a sheepish user.</p>
