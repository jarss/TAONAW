 <p>The idea of switching &ldquo;Completely&rdquo; Linux has been in my head since I wrote
about <a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/too-many-notifications/">having too many notifications</a> thrown at me whenever I log into Windows&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait. Isn't this entire blog written from Linux? Haven't I already switched to work from Linux? Almost 100% of the posts here concern Emacs, org-mode and Linux. &ldquo;What do you mean&rdquo;, you'd ask me, &ldquo;switch completely? Haven't you already?&rdquo; Yes. Kind of. Not really.</p>
<p>Let me back off a second, and tell you about Hedwig.</p>
<p>Hedwig, for those of you who don't know, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical%5Fcreatures%5Fin%5FHarry%5FPotter#Hedwig">Harry Potter's owl</a>. In the movie series, it is a large snowy owl that delivers Harry his mail. It is an obedient, yet confused owl. It's a bit of a mess, but you learn to like its character and weirdness.</p>
<p><img src="https://joshrollinswrites.com/ox-hugo/snow_owl.jpg" alt="">
<em>above: a snowy owl, straight from the books</em></p>
<p>My electronic devices (phone, laptop, and desktop) are usually named after the owls from Harry Potter. The Raspberry Pi which syncs all my org-mode files is called Hogwarts; the desktop is Hedwig, the phone is <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pigwidgeon">Pigwidgeon (pig)</a>, the laptop is <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermes">Hermes</a>. I am not sure when I came up with this naming scheme, but my liking to owls and Harry Potter clicked some time ago.</p>
<p>Just like the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Hedwig, my Desktop is a large (full tower, soon to be full ATX) machine. It is somewhat &ldquo;confused&rdquo; about certain things, like the time (I replaced a CMOS battery a couple of times), the state of Windows updates (aren't we all), and in general, its identity. Hedwig's been through Windows, Linux (various distros), and even a full Hackintosh at one point. It's the first computer I built completely from ordered parts, the case, motherboard, PSU, CPU, GPU (all the Us), optical and hard drives. This happened about 6 years ago, before I switched careers to IT.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of December, Hedwig is again a duel-boot machine: Windows and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSUSE">openSUSE</a> Linux. I decided to switch to openSUSE from Manjaro (which I use on my laptop) because I've been using openSUSE at work on my VM and it has been rock-solid; I also grown to like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaST">YaST</a> which helps when I don't remember how to change a setting from the command line. The idea is to eventually throw Windows out completely, and interact with it only in a VM on a full Linux machine. This is something I tried to tackle in the past but failed to do in the days before Emacs and Steam on Linux. Now, with my few favorite games available through Steam<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and Emacs leaving Windows and Office tools in the dust when it comes to file manipulations and writing, I think I will stay committed.</p>
<p>But I am writing these lines on my laptop. Hedwig's fresh Hugo installation, which I use for this blog, is not working yet. This is just one example of many: <a href="https://github.com/jonls/redshift/releases">Redshift</a>, Linux's trusted version of <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a> (or nightshift, if you speak Apple), <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">veracrypt</a>, which is a cross-platform encryption solution I use daily, and various codecs required to watch videos and compress videos<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with ffmpeg all require special configuration.</p>
<p>I've grown accustomed to these kinds of workarounds (Manjaro had it's own) on Linux. As much as I love the productivity and stability it brings with it, configuring a machine to work in Linux the way I want it to is never a quick process. In contrast, when I had to restore Hedwig to Windows in the past, all it took was signing into my Microsoft account; withing a minute, all my configurations including the wallpaper was in place. But that's the price you pay for having Microsoft (or Google, or Apple) having a probe up your behind and knowing everything you do. This eerie feeling of &ldquo;we know what's good for you&rdquo; is built into every OS, and exists outside of the technology word alone.</p>
<p>Everything fits into nice neat boxes, and so do you, so shut up and move along, I feel they tell me. Even though I find that I have less and less patience for folks who invents &ldquo;new ways&rdquo; and think &ldquo;originally&rdquo; these days, I also have less patience toward those who tell <em>me</em> to stick to the common ways of doing things. If we are all special none of us is unique, right?</p>
<p>For now, I find that overall there's little difference in my workflow from Manjaro in openSUSE. Most of my more per-machine tweaks happen in KDE, my preferred desktop environment, and Emacs's file paths which I still can't get to be the same when encrypting (would it kill someone to have the same mounting point for veracrypt in each distro?) Overall, I hope to stick to one distro so I can simply install from a pre-configured backup whenever I need to move to a new computer or a new VM. Using one (or two, one for work and one for home) init files for Emacs would also be great instead of having 5 slightly-different versions floating around.</p>
<p>But. While this sounds ideal, I don't think it'll ever happen. That's because I find that I <em>like</em> the little differences in how each machine looks and feels. A small XPS running Tumbleweed, openSUSE's rolling release, with white-on-black theme, neon-colored panel with Late and a top panel for system notifications to imitate a Mac like all the cool kids fits, while Hedwig is far more &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; with SUSE's Leap and a traditional black-on-white theme. I need at least a bit of personality on each machine. That's the bit the creative non-conforming dude inside the IT guy in me. Or perhaps I'm just nuts.</p>

<p>in case you're interested, these four games are currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaST">Cities Skylines</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/231430/Company%5Fof%5FHeroes%5F2/">Company of Heroes 2</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=oxygen+not+inc">Oxygen not Included</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest%5FDungeon/">Darkest Dungeon</a>. Over time (and age, I suppose) I discovered I'm less interested in FPSs and more interested in detailed-oriented games. I all-heatedly recommend you take a good long look at Oxygen not Included, especially if you're reading this blog regularly - it's perfect for problem-solvers who are looking to sync into a fun, cute, but very thought-provoking kind of game. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffmpeg/comments/e79qv8/maxium%5Fmp4%5Fcompression%5Fonly%5Fin%5Fopensuse/">I found out</a>, openSUSE doesn't come with <a href="https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html">libx264</a>, a codec used to compress videos into mp4 formats. It is so common-place in other distros and programs many (me included) don't even know it exists and does a fantastic job. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
