 <p>My family and I (those of us in the US, that is) have a micro version of Thanksgiving. There&rsquo;s no Turkey (we&rsquo;re not exactly big on meat), there are no large family encounters that break into their homogeneous splinters as time progresses. I usually bring my one partner with me over to my sister&rsquo;s, where we thaw our awkwardness next to the fireplace and watch my little niece run around like a leg-seeking missile, homing to the nearest standing person.</p>
<p>This time around I&rsquo;m going to bring <a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/my-new-sonya6000/">my new camera</a> and for the first time, I&rsquo;ll be snapping pictures of people. Up until now, I aimed my lenses at plants, squirrels, and birds. It&rsquo;s been a welcome distraction from work, which has been particularly reiterating for the last month.</p>
<p>I find that it gets harder to sit down and write when I&rsquo;m away from my writing for long periods, yet, as soon as I sit down in front of the soft beige window of my Emacs, the writing comes to me. There&rsquo;s also a difference between writing in my journal vs writing for the blog. The first is more raw, quick, with less caution. The second is slower, descriptive, with a dose of metaphors.</p>
<p>Writing like I&rsquo;m writing now, without an outline or a specific goal, is risky. Many times I end up without a message to deliver, much like a passenger boarding the train for the ride, not for the destination. Sometimes, this is OK. There&rsquo;s something nice to these posts, they tend to be more personal and inviting. There&rsquo;s more life between the lines of text, and the paragraphs seem to connect better.</p>
<p>I do have more things I want to write about, but much like before a run on cold weather, I need to stretch first. I want to check the workflow, from my typing fingers through org-mode through Emacs through GitHub to webpage you&rsquo;re hopefully reading now without an issue. There are parts of me participating in this that need to be re-tuned before I go on the next big topic, and this is a warm-up.</p>
<p>This then seems like a good place to stop and wish you all a happy Thanksgiving. I hope you enjoy the little moments with your family and friends and stir clear from black Friday deals of more stuff you don&rsquo;t need. Let me know how yours went if you feel like it.</p>
