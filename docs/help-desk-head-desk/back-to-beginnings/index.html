 <p>intro here</p>

<h2 id="how-to-read-the-keys">How to Read the Keys</h2>

<p>One of the early realizations that I&rsquo;m looking into something &ldquo;weird&rdquo; happened when I started looking into Emacs key &ldquo;shortcuts<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1">1</a></sup>&rdquo;. I came across things like saving (<code>C-x C-s</code>) and aborting (<code>C-g</code>) and suspected &ldquo;C&rdquo; was for control, but got thrown off by execute command (<code>M-x</code>). Only after reading more &ldquo;normal folks&rdquo; explinations like <a href="https://masteringemacs.org/book">Mastering Emacs</a> I understood this crazines.</p>

<p>Capital C is indeed the Control key, but capital M turns out to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta%5Fkey">Meta key</a>, which is mostly replaced by the Alt key on a regular PC keyboard of the Command key on a Mac. This means that the above command, <code>C-x C-s</code>, means &ldquo;press Control-X and then press S while still pressing the Control key.&rdquo; That last bit is important, because it&rsquo;s different from <code>C-x s</code>, for example, which means &ldquo;press Control-X, let go, and press s&rdquo;, which will invoke a different command altogether.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Emacs weird key combinations was the hardest part to get over. It does take time, but after I&rsquo;ve dopted these combos and started using them, they started to make more and more sense. Still there are exceptions. For example, I still don&rsquo;t use Emacs&rsquo;s built in move up (<code>C-p</code>) or down (<code>C-n</code>) and prefer the arrows instead except special cases<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-2"><a href="#fn:fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="overrated-emacs-built-in-help-system">Overrated: Emacs Built-in Help System</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to get a good amount of pushback for this, but I&rsquo;m just being honest when I say the built-in help system was little to no use to me back when I started using Emacs.</p>

<p>The Emacs built-in tutorial (<code>C-h t</code>) is very through and teaches you the basics one step at a time, but I was never the kind of person who would open a thick textbook and start reading cover to cover<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-3"><a href="#fn:fn-3">3</a></sup>. Emacs also comes with an extensive help system, and these are some of the pupular combos for it:</p>

<p><code>C-h a</code>: apropos-command: &ldquo;is there such a thing as [search term] and what does it do?&rdquo;
<code>C-h k</code>: describe-key: &ldquo;what does this key do?&rdquo;
<code>C-h f</code>: describe-function: &ldquo;what does this function or command do?&rdquo;
<code>C-h v</code>: describe-veriable: &ldquo;what does this variable does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as you can see, you need to at least have a generic idea of what you&rsquo;re looking for in order to get the help you need.</p>

<p>For instance, if you want to quit a command or escape something, usually by  pressing the &ldquo;Esc&rdquo; key anywhere else, you&rsquo;d be clueless to know it&rsquo;s the <code>C-g</code> key combo. You won&rsquo;t know to search for this key combo (<code>C-h k</code>) because this is exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for. You won&rsquo;t know what the function is that would cancel a command (is it cancel? escape? quit? and then there are variants of those, like quit-proccess, quit-window&hellip;) called, because you have no idea what it is in &ldquo;Emacs speak&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not a variable (that much I knew when I started) so <code>C-h v</code> is usless here, and even the friendlier &ldquo;search all&rdquo; <code>C-h a</code> seems to fall short here since you&rsquo;ll be presented with a large list of anything that contains the word &ldquo;quit&rdquo; (if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for) in differnent functions and packages, if you have any installed. In short, you&rsquo;d be lost.</p>

<p>Having to look up new key-combos like that when I started every single time I wanted to finish a paragraph was terrible, and I believe it&rsquo;s the wrong (and terribly boring) way to learn Emacs.</p>

<p>So, even with all its good intentions, I didn&rsquo;t use Emacs help system as much as many folks told me I should. Instead I turned to Google and many different forums where folks as confused as me posted these questions. The book I mentioned above also helped a great deal, since Mickey Petersen explains things to you as another <em>normal</em> computer user. I will get back to this point again and again.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-where-you-should-start">This is Where you Should Start</h2>

<p>OK, so I explained how to read Emacs&rsquo; weird key systems and then encouraged you <em>not</em> to  use the built-in help system. Great. Now what?</p>

<p>Since Emacs&rsquo; biggest issue when you start are the keys, we want to do something about making the environment more familiar. Again, many veteran Emacsers would yell at me here, and I myself cringe at the thought of using CUA mode these days, but you got to start somewhere familar, and this is a good place.</p>

<p>CUA mode, AKA Common User Access mode, is what you&rsquo;re probably familiar with in most Word proccessing programs. Control+C to copy, Control+X to cut, Control+v to paste, etc. To turn this on, Click the &ldquo;Options&rdquo; menu at the top of the Emacs window (yes, with your mouse&hellip;) and check the box next to &ldquo;Use CUA Keys&rdquo;. Then from the same menu all the way at the botton, click &ldquo;Save Options&rdquo; if you want this to be turned on every time you start Emacs. Congradualtions, you&rsquo;ve just saved yourself the mental pain of looking for &ldquo;paste&rdquo; in Emacs for 20 minutes and then realizing it doesn&rsquo;t exist (in Emacs speak, paste is &ldquo;yank&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve made Emacs a bit &ldquo;stupider&rdquo; to fit your needs (as you become better at Emacs, you&rsquo;ll learn quickly why CUA mode is not that good later on), it&rsquo;s time to tweak yourself a bit for Emacs.</p>

<p>Look down at your keyboard, at that Caps key. See it? Do you remember when&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ve used it? Did you ever wonder why such a useless key is so big and pronouced? Well then, congradulations. Time to kiss it goodbye. From now on, your Caps key will function is a secondary control key.</p>

<p>Emacs uses the control key a lot. And I mean, a <em>lot</em>. Today&rsquo;s modern keyboards are simply not meant for frequent control presses (remember, Emacs was invented back when a Meta key was a thing and &ldquo;paste&rdquo; did not exist in the computer user&rsquo;s lexicon). Emacs users developed a terrible condition called &ldquo;Emacs Pinky.&rdquo; And yes, I can tell you from personal experience (I have smaller hands), it&rsquo;s a real thing. Many Emacs guros wrote pages on avoiding the Emacs pinky (<a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs%5Fpinky.html">here&rsquo;s a good one</a>), but using your Caps key as control is probably one of the eaisest.</p>

<p>This is easy to do in Linux and Macs, but somewhat tricker in Windows. The best tool I found for that is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/ctrl2cap">Ctrl2Cap</a>. Take care of this now. Don&rsquo;t be that person who knows better. Don&rsquo;t be me. Just do it. Emacs has very smart ways of turning any words or letter to upper-cases in ways that will blow your socks off later.</p>

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<div class="footnotes">

<hr />

<ol>
<li id="fn:fn-1">Back then, pressing keys instead of using the mouse was refered to as &ldquo;shortcuts.&rdquo; I knew Emacs works directly from the keyboard, but I didn&rsquo;t know how to refer to this odd practice which is second nature now.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:fn-1">[^ back]</a></li>
<li id="fn:fn-2">Sometimes pressing the up arrow key is taken by another, more familiar function. When I ran shell inside emacs (I don&rsquo;t do that much anymore), pressing <code>C-p</code> became important because it would take the cursor and move it inside the text window, <em>not</em> repeat the last command, which is what the up arrow key meant.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:fn-2">[^ back]</a></li>
<li id="fn:fn-3">This was never the way for me to learn anything, particularly computer stuff. As a matter of fact, this is one of a few big reasons I did not do well in college in computer programming calsses and decided to put computers behind me for later in life. :EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: Help Desk Head Desk :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: you-are-on-sale :EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2019-10-18: The fan noise that came from my Windows machine finally got on my nerves, so I turned off my PC. I turned it on the next day, not thinking much about anything, my coffee at hand. As soon as I logged in I was greated with all kinds of windows opening on me, intruding on my space, notifying me on updates, of new games sales, of emails&hellip; &ldquo;click me! No! Click me!!&rdquo; I heard them yell in the back of my head. I put my coffee down and shut my Windows PC off again, shaking my head.
