 <p>A few years back, I was an avid user of Evernote. That was a period of information &ldquo;innocence&rdquo; for me, before I knew much about Linux and switched careers to IT. Back then, Evernote was an amazing discovery. It was the first serious digital (and, to be honest, analog as well) system I built. I remember many nights where I drifted off to sleep thinking about how to tag and achieve my information in it. To this day I have plenty of memories stored away in its achieve files &ndash; though they have been since downloaded and converted from the App&rsquo;s native format.</p>
<p>This morning, YouTube&rsquo;s algorithm picked up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rNUpXYCcrA">a video from Evernote</a> and threw it my way as a suggestion. It&rsquo;s a short introduction to a promised upcoming series from Evernote, called Behind the Scenes. Introduced directly by Evernote&rsquo;s current CEO, Ian Small, this seems to be an honest attempt to &ldquo;take us behind the scenes&hellip; and show us what [Evernote] is working on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evernote is a for-profit company with a product that is very different than org-mode. While I have no desire or need to switch from org in the near future, it would be interesting to see what kind of challenges the makers of a popular note-taking app come up with. Who knows, perhaps I could learn a thing or two.</p>
