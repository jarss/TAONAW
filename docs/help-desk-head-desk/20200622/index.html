 <p>At first, I only noticed an increase in back pains. Then there was general restlessness that didn&rsquo;t allow me to concentrate on long-term projects at work. There was a nagging feeling of &ldquo;I miss something&rdquo; coming from my body, not so much my brain. And then, one day at the office during my on-site duty, I pulled up my screen and keyboard to its standing position and it hit me: <em>I need to stand</em>.</p>

<p>In the past, a standing desk was a gimmick I contributed to yoga-types folks and others who had back or posture issues<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. When a co-worker left us for another place, I adopted his Ergotron Workfit because it had two keyboard trays which I needed (I work with a Mac and a Windows workstation at the same time) and I thought standing up would be a nice &ldquo;perk&rdquo; since I often just enjoy walking around or talk to people while standing.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t know is that shifting my weight helped me concentrate and became a big part of my morning ritual. The habit of standing up in the morning when I get to the office was so hard-wired that even my manager said at one point he can&rsquo;t talk to me before I pull up my desk to standing position and prepare my oatmeal cup.</p>
<h2 id="the-research">The Research</h2>
<p>The research was fun. A full standing desk was out of the question because of its price and the fact that I already had a nice IKEA desk that fit my NYC-size room nicely. I knew I&rsquo;m looking for a standing desk converter, a fancy term for a keyboard-mouse-screen elevator. Indeed, I first aimed for cheap options from Amazon because I didn&rsquo;t think of a converter to be more than that.</p>
<p>My go-to website to get information for quality products when there are several options offered is New York Time&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/">Wirecutter</a>. While it tends to lean more toward expensive things in general (it feels like sometimes they do it just so they have a &ldquo;budget option&rdquo; to add to the review) it is a good place to get a general idea. Their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-standing-desk-converters/">best standing desk converters</a> review was helpful.</p>
<p>At the time, $400 seemed like a <em>lot</em> of money for something I could just use a bunch of boxes for, so after reading the full article (you need to keep scrolling past the &ldquo;The Research&rdquo; part) I carefully did some <del>Goolging</del> Duck-duck-going and stumble unto <a href="https://www.workwhilewalking.com/">Work While Standing</a>. This website seemed like a shallow review site full of ads at start, but as I read more into their reviews I saw that wasn&rsquo;t the case. Their &ldquo;<a href="https://www.workwhilewalking.com/standing-desk-converter-reviews">What is a Standing Desk Converter?</a>&rdquo; introduction was very informative and showed me what each type of converter does, what it&rsquo;s good for, and why sit-stand desks tend to be more expensive <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The information on both sites helped me realize a sit-stand converter is a three-in-one solution for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My ultra-wide monitor&rsquo;s<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> stand that came with it was a piece of junk. It barely supported the weight of the monitor, and I was already searching for a better stand that wouldn&rsquo;t allow it to wiggle and wobble at every slight movement, including typing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realized that, as Wirecutter noted, the screen does need to be higher up when you stand than when you sit down (try it - you&rsquo;ll see that when you stand there&rsquo;s more space between your eyes and your typing hands). This has been an issue that has been bothering me for some time in the office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My narrow IKEA desk and room setup meant that I didn&rsquo;t want a desk that would push toward me as I raise it. I also didn&rsquo;t like how the Z-shape legs of the other converters looked like on the desk, blocking off the area under the desk in its upper position like a cage. I wanted something cleaner looking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>from there, it was easy to conclude that the <a href="https://www.ergodesktop.com/product-types/single-monitor-solutions">Kangaroo pro model from Ergo Desktop</a> was right for me: it included the extra feature that allowed the screen to move independently from the tray, but at the same time, I didn&rsquo;t need the Elite series which included an electric motor for it.</p>
<p>The final tune-in was the measurements: turns out that the <a href="https://www.ergodesktop.com/kangaroo-pro-junior">Kangaroo Pro Junior</a>&lsquo;s depth was the perfect fit for my desk; the bigger Pro would be too wide, with its tray pushing out toward my chest and covering the drawers of my desk. The desk had a clean, industrial look to it that I liked. I also found a coupon online just before I placed my purchase, reducing the cost of the desk by $20. Shipping was free of charge. Nice.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-and-some-hacking">Set Up and Some Hacking</h2>
<p>The Junior Pro came in a large, flat, heavy box. Kind of like a flat TV screen. Because I don&rsquo;t trust USPS to ship anything to my home address (that&rsquo;s a long story) I shipped it to my office instead and took it home from there. I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m in a rather OK shape and I handled the box OK, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend carrying the box a long-distance or up the stairs without help. It was just heavy enough to be a bit much.</p>
<p>Assembly was easy enough. There weren&rsquo;t many parts, and the instructions were clearly printed in full colors (you can also view the PDF on their website). The only tough part was the monitor: because of its size, it was difficult to hold it with one hand while adjusting the stand so the screw holes fit just right. This is also when I ran into more problems with my screen.</p>
<p>As it turns out, my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B9IDLAW/ref=ppx%5Fyo%5Fdt%5Fb%5Fsearch%5Fasin%5Ftitle?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">ultra-wide monitor</a> has its VERSA screw holes a bit lower than they should be. The Kangaroo&rsquo;s screen-tilt lock doesn&rsquo;t provide much friction as is, and it was not possible to lock the screen at a straight angle. It kept tilting downwards, hanging on the adjustable tilt screw. Another issue was the screen&rsquo;s HDMI socket location, straight in the back, where it hits the metal shaft of the stand. This is a known issue with the monitor judging from the complaints on the Amazon page, where people ran into this issue while trying to mount the monitor against a wall. In short: this is a problem with my monitor, not the new desk.</p>
<p>I fixed the problem temporally by placing Styrofoam between the screen&rsquo;s mounting stem, which was sticking out a bit, and the metal shaft of the screen raiser. I contacted Ergo directly about my issue and got a reply the next day: they were shipping me another screw which was supposed to replace the tilt break. After playing around with it I found that it was better to use the screw they sent as a stopper, which fit in one of the grooves of the metal shaft, than a replacement for the break as they suggested. This locks the screen tilt in one position, but I&rsquo;m fairly comfortable with how it stands now and I don&rsquo;t need it to move. The result is a wobbly-less typing environment both for standing and sitting.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-more-words">A few More Words</h2>
<p>Getting a standing desk converter is easily the biggest upgrade for my work environment in recent years. At start I didn&rsquo;t want to spend so much money on something that seemed to be a &ldquo;perk,&rdquo; but the quality of the product, the way it makes the whole room look, and the inviting feeling I get every morning when I stand at it with my fresh cup of coffee are priceless. Still, this is a highly personal choice. I can&rsquo;t recommend this standing desk solution for everyone: too much depends on individual quirks, measurements, budget, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, This post wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without praising org-mode again. A picture is worth a thousand words, so here, have a look:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re only seeing half of it since my thoughts (under the closed headers) are just too long to fit here. org-mode made it not only easy to write down details as I was browsing and reading but also kept me organized with my thoughts and prevented me from going back in loops over conclusions I&rsquo;ve already made.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because sit-stand converters effectively include a stand for the screen. Other converters are essentially just a raised tray on which you also put the screen with the keyboard and mouse; with sit-stands, the screen mounts to the back. Better models include independent raising mechanism. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Probably another post in itself, an ultra-wide monitor is another must-have in my setup today. It is not as heavy and messy as having two monitors while providing much-needed work space, not to mention good gaming experience (which is horrible on a dual screens in my opinion). <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
