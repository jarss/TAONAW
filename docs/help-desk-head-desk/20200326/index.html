 <p>There are currently three unfinished drafts in TAONAW&rsquo;s main org file<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It seems as if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Coronavirus%5Fdisease%5F2019">pandemic</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%5Fdistancing">social-distancing</a> dried out my ideas and ability to express myself. On Tuesday I took a walk into the park and captured some flowers and birds with my camera. As it turned out, the walk outdoors recharged my batteries. I came back home and sat down to finally record my first video about photography. Here are the details about how I did it and why.</p>
<p>TAONAW seeks to use free technologies for content, and broadcasting video is another suck example. I was surprised at how easy it was to set up an account and upload the video to <a href="https://video.autizmo.xyz">https://video.autizmo.xyz</a>, an instant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerTube">PeerTube</a>. While YouTube and Instagram are unavoidable to reach photography enthusiasts, I&rsquo;m going to use them only as secondary sources<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created a channel for <a href="https://video.autizmo.xyz/video-channels/taonaw/videos">TAONAW</a> where I plan to keep uploading photograph-related content. There are additional options and information to add to the channel which I need to revisit. I also need to follow up with a YouTube channel, which will work Like with my content on <a href="https://medium.com/@Josh%5FRollins">Medium</a>, presenting older and selective content. Since I&rsquo;m not bothered by making a profit out of the videos, much of YouTube&rsquo;s settings do not make a difference to me and I&rsquo;ll just leave them at default. It&rsquo;s a headache next to the simplicity on PeerTube.</p>
<p>To create the video, I used my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony%5F%25CE%25B16000">Sony a6000</a>, the camera I&rsquo;ve been using to take my photos since last October, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KP473Q/ref=ppx%5Fyo%5Fdt%5Fb%5Fsearch%5Fasin%5Ftitle?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">AmazonBasics 60-Inch Tripod</a> which I purchased two months ago. Copying the video to <a href="https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20191208/">Hedwig</a>, my desktop computer, is a breeze thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwenview">Gwenview</a> which comes with KDE. I Then edited the .mts video file with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShot">OpenShot</a>, cutting ambulances&rsquo; sirens (I live next to a hospital)  and added comments in text. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg">FFmpeg</a> has been a tool of choice for a couple of years, and I used it here to compress and brighten up the video since I underestimated how dark my room is for the camera (learning from mistakes is the only way to learn).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://video.autizmo.xyz/videos/watch/2ecdc35c-ad1d-4bcd-8d92-3df21a117136">resulting video</a> is not as bad as I feared, but of course, there&rsquo;s much more to learn. The challenges I&rsquo;ve encountered were not technical: the biggest one turned out to be finding a spot that doesn&rsquo;t show the mess in my room; I ended up arranging my photos on my wall. Another was finding what to say: not <em>lack</em> of what to say, but how to say it, how to keep to the point. It is very different than writing a blog post and editing it later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear comments, suggestions and general questions about the video and the topic itself.</p>

<p>I always like to link to Wikipedia articles when possible, but I find myself at awe at the richness of information happening right now when the members of this dedicated community build a whole subsite inside Wikipedia just about COVID-19. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, please take a look, even if just to see the list of resources and links at the bottom of these articles. So much free and available information. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
