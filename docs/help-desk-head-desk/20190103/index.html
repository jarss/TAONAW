</time>
 <p>There's probably an unwritten rule (and if not, there should be) that the amount of documents needed to for a project is roughly equivelent to half the number of people working on the project. Our department alone is about 20 folks, and for a recent big project we need to work with other devisions, so at this point I can't even tell you how many documents we need to keep track of.</p>
<p>So called &ldquo;colleberative&rdquo; tools for a project just increases mess and confusion. My tool of choice has been org-mode for quite some time, and I can tell you it makes a night and day difference. Here's what I learned from not using it.</p>
<p>At the beginning, there was one email and one spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was a list of our inventory that needed to be tested; the email contained a generic workflow for the testing that needed to be done.</p>
<p>The Problems start when I tested the workflow and found it to be inaccurate for our work environment. That meant I had to communicate it to the department in chage of that workflow, going through the appropiate channels. Communication, as it usually happens when there are many people involved, failed. I should have picked on the inevitable signles right then as I have many times in the past, but I didn't, and that was the mistake.</p>
<p>Instead of creating notes for myself in org-mode about what I encountered, why there is a problem, what's my workaround, who are the people I need to contact and when to expect an answer, I just brought the issue up in a meeting and otherwise kept to my own devices.</p>
<p>A note in Onenote or a remind in the calendar could have helped, perhaps a follow-up notes in one of our generic project spreadsheets which describes roles and issues. The problem with all of these is that they are <em>collaborative</em> tools which we have been using already, and therefor, constantly manipulated by other people. These are the same tools that end up producing the kind of mess we now had have on our hands.</p>
<p>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with teamwork or collaboration. I work in a unit of people, and we all count on each other. Integrating a new large product to our environement which we know close to nothing about has to include other people who do understand it. Communication needs to happen so we can discuss the problems and find solutions. I think everyone in a modern work environment knows that.</p>
<p>The choice of <em>when</em> to coloborate however, what tools to use, how to communicate and when, that's where there's a problem. that's because one person is used to emails, while another prefers phonecalls; I like org-mode while one of my teammate still prefers to write by hand; managment likes meetings and generic timelines while we prefer workflows and short bursts of full details. You can't have one source of communication used by 20 people and have 20 people 100% satisfied with it. <em>You</em> are the only person who should organize <em>your</em> stuff, and it is up to you to bring your points to the agreed-upon public medium, whatever it is.</p>
<p>That's why there's always a draft before there's a report, an agenda before a meeting (or, there should be), an outline before an essay. No one should have access to your notes because if they do, it immidetly becomes &ldquo;contaminated&rdquo; by their thought process.</p>
<p>I should have used org-mode and I didn't.</p>
<p>Org-mode is not just a tool, it's a lifestyle. I don't just use org-mode to mantain a todo list, or to create a projects, to know what's on my agenda, or to update my knowledge base. Org-mode is for <em>all of these</em>. At the same time it is an enigma to anyone else, contained in a VM running linux, otherwise completely isolated from my work environment. This is what makes it the perfect tool for the job.</p>
<p>What I should have done start by creating a simple single task on my agenda: &ldquo;follow up on workflow fix with John Doe.&rdquo; It would be scheduled for the next day, around morning. Then I would chat or call John Doe and write down notes from our conversation into the task body itself as we talk. Later, I will break these chunks of texts into additional tasks, naturally creating a project out of that first initial task with sub-tasks. Because this is a large project which involved many people, opinions, and changing modes of actions, these would be described in a seperate sub-tree named &ldquo;log&rdquo; which is not a task and is not scheduled, but contains dates for each entry. A log for the project used to further break down tasks. When a certain task is completed or ready to be reviewed, it can be exported from orgmode to html, and then copy-pasted into email, or an article for our common knowledge-base.</p>
<p>I can write all of this in great detail now because this is exactly what I ended up doing, only two weeks two late. Today, the project is big enough to be contained in its own org file and shows on my agenda by name, instead of the generic &ldquo;work&rdquo; category I use to seperate personal from work tasks.</p>
<p>My workflow for dealing with big projects, in steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a task: this is the start of any acionable item, often before I know it's going to turn into a project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the task and realize it needs to be broken further down: The breakdown can happen as I work on it or before I start; either way I record what needs to be done or was done in subtasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main task changes its keyword from &ldquo;TODO&rdquo; to &ldquo;ACTIVE&rdquo;, this means to me it's a project. It does no longer have scheduled time, but timestamps which I strech from day to day or week to week, as I work on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the project is very large or involves a lot of peopel and meeting, I usually create another subtree without a keyword called &ldquo;log&rdquo; and keep it on top. This log contains non-agenda dates of when each entry was entered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a project contains a log and several subtasks, I will create a sesperate org file just for it. This will keep it in context and possibly can be used later to export should I need it to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually, my projects end at step 3. I later go in and change from &ldquo;ACTIVE&rdquo; to &ldquo;DONE&rdquo; when the project is finished. Steps 4 and 5 are reserved for larger projects which are usually measured in months, not weeks.</p>
