  <h1>Some Good Things</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-10-30T00:00:00-0400 class="post-date">Tue, Oct 30, 2018</time>
  <p>Last Saturday I had an encounter with dear ol&rsquo; Aunt Dee. She&rsquo;s like a lifelong buddy of mine, never too far. She&rsquo;s a shy quiet wall flower, sneaks up on you, undetected. You only realize she&rsquo;s around after her long scrawny hands are wrapped around you, hugging, her perfume brings back a daze of nostalgia&hellip;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was playing another round of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities:%5FSkylines">Cities Skylines</a>, and realized I&rsquo;m not much into the game anymore. As a matter of fact, I was forcing it for the last hour. I promised myself to go to gym, and a part of me was trying to use any possible excuse to keep me glued to that chair. It was gray and cold, it was a weekend after a hard week, I wasn&rsquo;t in the mood, I didn&rsquo;t eat enough, bla bla bla. I recognized this train of thoughts: &ldquo;ah! I know you&hellip; you depression you, how have you been?&rdquo; and checked my list. I think anyone who&rsquo;s been with dear aunt Dee for long enough has a similar list.</p>

<p>Sunday was different because I started it differently. The first thing I did was going back to my elements. This means, without getting all fancy about my life philosophy, that I did my morning exercise (few stretches, pull-ups, little weights) and meditation. I took my time before I set at the computer: first there was one round of exercise, then I made coffee, then a second round of exercise. Then there was meditation, which was a powerful mind-dump. I talked to myself about things that are important to me, things that I&rsquo;ve neglected. Then the meditation itself, a series of deep breaths while counting. This is one of my life facts: when meditation is really needed, there&rsquo;s always strong resistance to it at start. By the end I don&rsquo;t want to finish it. Putting my mind on a state of neutral after emphasizing to myself things I care about is powerful. I&rsquo;m far from being a meditation master and I don&rsquo;t read much on the matter, but this form of meditation always came naturally to me.</p>

<p>After that, Sunday started taking shape. I know so because my room started looking like my room again. First (it&rsquo;s always first) the bed. Then laundry. Then the closet, which was something I haven&rsquo;t dealt with in a while. Cleaning my room is similar to cleaning my head. It&rsquo;s odd, a made bed makes me feel so much better. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I don&rsquo;t argue, it works. Later on I went to gym again, this time without a long struggle. Later still, I enjoyed sharing a different video game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return%5Fof%5Fthe%5FObra%5FDinn">The Return of the Obra Dinn</a>, with my partner.</p>

<p>This time I didn&rsquo;t game as an exercise in solitude and forgetfulness. It was a mutual experience of puzzle solving. In retro respect, it reminds me of my grandparents playing bridge together, only with more high fives and laughs. There&rsquo;s something special about sharing something as intimate as a video game with someone who&rsquo;s been around long enough to share such an intimate thing with. Those of you who game know what I&rsquo;m talking about: getting someone into your bed is not as nearly as intimate as having someone by your side while you play a video game, let along take an active part of it. My partners are the only people alive who can grab the mouse or the phone out of my hand mid-action and not encounter the scorning disdain on my face.</p>

<p>Somewhere between the meditation, the game, the avocado salad/guacamole I&rsquo;ve made, I found peace. Aunt Dee was gone, out of town, see-you-next-time. I&rsquo;ve had a good day at work yesterday (not excellent, not awesome, just good). It&rsquo;s important that I mention it for myself, for next time, and for you, the other nephews of aunt Dee out there (or her relatives) who might find comfort in this.</p>

<p>Have a good rest of the week!</p>
