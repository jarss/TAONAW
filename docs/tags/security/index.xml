      <description>&lt;p&gt;News that surfaced last week report of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/&#34;&gt;security flaw&lt;/a&gt; that exists in the most popular password managers out there like LastPass, KeePass, and 1Password among others. Does this mean people should stop using them? No. Will people use this news as yet another excuse not to use password managers? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using LastPass for the last 5 years and been happy with it. I recommended it to friends, family, and co-workers. I tried to sell it through its convenience: once set up, LastPass auto-fills user and password fields, and can even log you into a website directly. LastPass also creates complicated passwords automatically and is available on every major browser, iPhones and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it seems like even LastPass&amp;rsquo;s time has come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
