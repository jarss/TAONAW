&lt;p&gt;This is my SSH server&#39;s log, and this looks like a good time to talk about basic ssh server security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;News that surfaced last week report of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/&#34;&gt;security flaw&lt;/a&gt; that exists in the most popular password managers out there like LastPass, KeePass, and 1Password among others. Does this mean people should stop using them? No. Will people use this news as yet another excuse not to use password managers? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From LastPass to KeePass</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/lastpass-to-keepass/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been using LastPass for the last 5 years and been happy with it. I recommended it to friends, family, and co-workers. I tried to sell it through its convenience: once set up, LastPass auto-fills user and password fields, and can even log you into a website directly. LastPass also creates complicated passwords automatically and is available on every major browser, iPhones and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems like even LastPass&#39;s time has come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hub</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a consisted, stable server for my org files has been on my mind for a while. I bought a Raspberry PI (RP) to serve as a file server to be used as a &amp;ldquo;hub&amp;rdquo; that will always be on and host these files. This is a description of the setup of what I&#39;ve done to make this work. I hope you&#39;d find this useful! Feel free to contact me with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
