      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt at explaining a full (though simple) script I wrote. I always say I&amp;rsquo;m no programmer (or scripter). Despite that, I somehow ended up creating a couple of useful scripts on my Linux machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My elementary scripts are work in progress. I keep tweaking them as I learn and create new ones. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from experienced scripters just as I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from those of you who never opened Nano before. Feedback is always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
