      <title>Scripting in Bash 102</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt at explaining a full (though simple) script I wrote. I always say I&amp;rsquo;m no programmer (or scripter). Despite that, I somehow ended up creating a couple of useful scripts on my Linux machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My elementary scripts are work in progress. I keep tweaking them as I learn and create new ones. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from experienced scripters just as I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from those of you who never opened Nano before. Feedback is always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Regex for Old macOS Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At work, we are a small team serving a very large gorup of clients. Because of that, automation is very importnat. It is impossible to get to each client directly, and we constantly have our plates full with other projects, walk-ins and general maintanance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One project that was recently brought up was detecting and replacing old company-owned Macs that are out of warranty and cannot be upgraded to Apple&amp;rsquo;s newest macOS, which at the time of this writing is &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828&#34;&gt;macOS Mojavi (10.14)&lt;/a&gt;. the idea is to locate these machines and retire them. To do such projects, we use system managment tool, KACE. KACE used to belong to Dell, and is still mostly used for Windows machines (it is most usefuls on Dells, obviously) but in this line of work it&amp;rsquo;s many times using the tools you already have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
