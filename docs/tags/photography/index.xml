      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are currently three unfinished drafts in TAONAW&amp;rsquo;s main org file&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It seems as if the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Coronavirus%5Fdisease%5F2019&#34;&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%5Fdistancing&#34;&gt;social-distancing&lt;/a&gt; dried out my ideas and ability to express myself. On Tuesday I took a walk into the park and captured some flowers and birds with my camera. As it turned out, the walk outdoors recharged my batteries. I came back home and sat down to finally record my first video about photography. Here are the details about how I did it and why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying taking photos since October and decided to start recording videos, expanding the way I publish content. As it turns out, recording, editing, and storing videos is not as simple as I thought. The outcome has been holding back on discussing one of my biggest passions these days. I want to change that today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A new Camera Instead of Pixel4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Google was about to officially announce the new Pixel4, I was excited about getting a new phone with an improved camera and enhanced night vision. However, not even a week later, I ended up with a digital camera instead. A few weeks later with my camera, I am happy with my purchase and the new things it brought into my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
