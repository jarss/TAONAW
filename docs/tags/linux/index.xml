      <title>Best Tools for the job: Duplicati</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve kept postponing since &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20191208/&#34;&gt;switching to Linux on my desktop&lt;/a&gt; has been my backup system. I wrote a script on my raspberry pi to create an encrypted tar achieves of my org files twice a day transfer them over to Hedwig (my desktop), which will then find their way into an online backup provider. Now that I switched to Linux, that system stopped working, and I&amp;rsquo;ve kept postponing the critical need for an online backup too long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Switching to Kubuntu over openSuSE</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20200108/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20191208/&#34;&gt;After giving openSuSE a try&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to switch to Kubuntu. So far it&amp;rsquo;s been a month or so since the switch, and everything I want works to the point that I havne&amp;rsquo;t booted into Windows once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Long Goodbye to Windows</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20191208/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of switching &amp;ldquo;Completely&amp;rdquo; Linux has been in my head since I wrote
about &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/too-many-notifications/&#34;&gt;having too many notifications&lt;/a&gt; thrown at me whenever I log into Windows&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this entire blog written from Linux? Haven&amp;rsquo;t I already switched to work from Linux? Almost 100% of the posts here concern Emacs, org-mode and Linux. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;d ask me, &amp;ldquo;switch completely? Haven&amp;rsquo;t you already?&amp;rdquo; Yes. Kind of. Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me back off a second, and tell you about Hedwig.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Too Many Notifications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fan noise that came from my Windows machine finally got on my nerves, so I turned off my PC. I turned it on the next day, not thinking much about anything, my coffee at hand. As soon as I logged in I was greeted with windows opening on me notifying me on updates, of new games sales, of emails&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;click me! No! Click me!&amp;rdquo; Yeeeesh. I put my coffee down and shut down my Windows PC off again. How did I get to this point again?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why do They Use a Mac?</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/why-admins-use-mac/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Macs are evil. Macs are expensive pieces of toy hardware, which is often not up to par with what&amp;rsquo;s offered on the market (my personal biggest annoyances are the keyboards and the touchpad). Everything you do on a Mac you can do on Linux better&amp;hellip; and so on. If that&amp;rsquo;s true, why are so many professionals in IT environments (which are otherwise Windows-based) use Macs? I want to see if my perspective changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick Updates: June</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have any means of tracking how many readers I have on this blog, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel a little bit responsible for my audience. This is an attempt to see how a quick &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s up&amp;rdquo; post while the blog is otherwise idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a few quick updates about what&amp;rsquo;s coming up:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Switching to Manjaro</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/switching-to-manjaro/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux as my daily driver for the last three years. I work with Windows on a daily basis and I support Mac issues all the time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever go back to using either one for my personal data. As a matter of fact, it&amp;rsquo;s Linux which made an appearance at work: without my VM and Org-mode, I would probably be drowning under hips of emails, meeting invites, support tickets, and the constant in-person walk-ins into our work environment.</description>

      <title>The Hub</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/raspberry-pi-org-hub/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a consisted, stable server for my org files has been on my mind for a while. I bought a Raspberry PI (RP) to serve as a file server to be used as a &amp;ldquo;hub&amp;rdquo; that will always be on and host these files. This is a description of the setup of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done to make this work. I hope you&amp;rsquo;d find this useful! Feel free to contact me with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
