      <title>Scripting in Bash 102</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt at explaining a full (though simple) script I wrote. I always say I&amp;rsquo;m no programmer (or scripter). Despite that, I somehow ended up creating a couple of useful scripts on my Linux machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My elementary scripts are work in progress. I keep tweaking them as I learn and create new ones. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from experienced scripters just as I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from those of you who never opened Nano before. Feedback is always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why do They Use a Mac?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Macs are evil. Macs are expensive pieces of toy hardware, which is often not up to par with what&amp;rsquo;s offered on the market (my personal biggest annoyances are the keyboards and the touchpad). Everything you do on a Mac you can do on Linux better&amp;hellip; and so on. If that&amp;rsquo;s true, why are so many professionals in IT environments (which are otherwise Windows-based) use Macs? I want to see if my perspective changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have any means of tracking how many readers I have on this blog, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel a little bit responsible for my audience. This is an attempt to see how a quick &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s up&amp;rdquo; post while the blog is otherwise idle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a few quick updates about what&amp;rsquo;s coming up:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Switching to Manjaro</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/switching-to-manjaro/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux as my daily driver for the last three years. I work with Windows on a daily basis and I support Mac issues all the time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever go back to using either one for my personal data. As a matter of fact, it&amp;rsquo;s Linux which made an appearance at work: without my VM and Org-mode, I would probably be drowning under hips of emails, meeting invites, support tickets, and the constant in-person walk-ins into our work environment.</description>
