      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a journal (though infrequently) since my early 20s. A thick notebook with a table of contents on its first two pages made of a long list of dates.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always dislike it when I read a post explaining why there&amp;rsquo;s been a break in posting. It&amp;rsquo;s usually a sign that the next post will be the last if it will happen at all, and it&amp;rsquo;s always some excuse about being busy, life getting in the way, etc. etc. So I guess now it&amp;rsquo;s my turn to write one of these posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week has been a good example of emotional exhaustion. Because influences overall productivity, relationships, and health (both mental and physical) I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
