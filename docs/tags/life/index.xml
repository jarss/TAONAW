      <title>Standing Desk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, I only noticed an increase in back pains. Then there was general restlessness that didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to concentrate on long-term projects at work. There was a nagging feeling of &amp;ldquo;I miss something&amp;rdquo; coming from my body, not so much my brain. And then, one day at the office during my on-site duty, I pulled up my screen and keyboard to its standing position and it hit me: &lt;em&gt;I need to stand&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Distancing Due to COVID19, Day 55. What are the effects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that comes to mind immediately is updating this blog. It was left untouched for a month (my last post has been growing mold for a couple of weeks, originally written in April). Other DDTC effects include: working from home and providing support to users remotely, lack of exercise, and &amp;ldquo;artificial depression,&amp;rdquo; as I call it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning from New York City, the new epicenter of COVID-19. This morning, I want to share a few tips that helped me cope with social distancing, keep mostly calm, and otherwise remain productive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About Ease of Use vs Indepence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like hating on Google (or Apple, or Amazon, or whatever tech giant) is the hip thing to do these days. I want to raise a couple of points to argue otherwise, and explain how I try to find balance in a monopoly-driven world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The joy of Taking Photos</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying taking photos since October and decided to start recording videos, expanding the way I publish content. As it turns out, recording, editing, and storing videos is not as simple as I thought. The outcome has been holding back on discussing one of my biggest passions these days. I want to change that today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Of Journaling</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/of-journaling/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a journal (though infrequently) since my early 20s. A thick notebook with a table of contents on its first two pages made of a long list of dates. At the time, life was too chaotic to keep the habit uninterrupted. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure at what point I converted to digital form, but I flirted with digital journaling for years before it became my primary method of keeping a journal&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What has Been Going on</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always dislike it when I read a post explaining why there&amp;rsquo;s been a break in posting. It&amp;rsquo;s usually a sign that the next post will be the last if it will happen at all, and it&amp;rsquo;s always some excuse about being busy, life getting in the way, etc. etc. So I guess now it&amp;rsquo;s my turn to write one of these posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week has been a good example of emotional exhaustion. Because influences overall productivity, relationships, and health (both mental and physical) I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
