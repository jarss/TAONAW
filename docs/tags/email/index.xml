      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8004&#34;&gt;irreal&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bfsck6/mu4e%5Ffor%5Fdummies/&#34;&gt;mu4e for dummies&lt;/a&gt; on my todo list for a week before I decided to give it up. At first, I thought it was because setting the time and following through the guide was too much of a &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; in my head to tackle, so I broke it down. Then, as I looked at the individual components, I realized it&amp;rsquo;s more complicated then technicalities alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
