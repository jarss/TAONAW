      <title>How I Tackle Projects With org-mode</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20200123/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been using org-mode, a natural process of project management has emerged. For the first time in my adult life, I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt the need to switch systems of productivity. I even enjoy looking at my projects nowadays, a list of organized notes, tasks, and information. I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed projects here before, but not in this detail. I hope this would be beneficial to others, especially those new to org-mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons from a Huge Project at Work</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20200103/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s probably an unwritten rule (and if not, there should be) that the amount of documents needed for a project is roughly equivalent to half the number of people working on the project. Our department alone is about 20 folks, and for a recent big project we need to work with other divisions, so at this point I can&amp;rsquo;t even tell you how many documents we need to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, I use org-mode for everything. But this time I was foolish enough not to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Of Journaling</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/of-journaling/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a journal (though infrequently) since my early 20s. A thick notebook with a table of contents on its first two pages made of a long list of dates. At the time, life was too chaotic to keep the habit uninterrupted. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure at what point I converted to digital form, but I flirted with digital journaling for years before it became my primary method of keeping a journal&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Submenus in org-mode Capture</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/sub-menus-in-org/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/org-capture-in-files/&#34;&gt;In my last post&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed how I (finally) found out that I can use entire org files as capture templates. This is a basic feature that works out of the box, but the org-mode manual doesn&amp;rsquo;t give it enough exposure in my opinion. Turns out it &lt;a href=&#34;https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8161&#34;&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t just me&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was expanding my checklists and learning more &amp;ldquo;trivial&amp;rdquo; org-capture features, I discovered more useful things, but ran out of time to write about them. It&amp;rsquo;s now time to get back to more &amp;ldquo;basics&amp;rdquo; of org-capture again for some helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Org-capture in Files</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/org-capture-in-files/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty busy org-mode-ly speaking. There is a lot to say, and as I was writing my post, more ideas occurred to me that behooved me to stop writing and experiment more, which lead to more interesting results, which meant I ran out of time to write about the results. When I finally returned to my post this morning, I realized there&amp;rsquo;s so much to explain, I can&amp;rsquo;t include it all in one go. Here you go, part one of my latest adventure in org-mode: org-capture from org files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick Updates: June</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have any means of tracking how many readers I have on this blog, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel a little bit responsible for my audience. This is an attempt to see how a quick &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s up&amp;rdquo; post while the blog is otherwise idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a few quick updates about what&amp;rsquo;s coming up:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jamierubin.net/2019/06/13/writing-in-the-digital-age-an-introduction/#comments&#34;&gt;Jamie T. Rubin&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;As a writer, I naturally want to spend my time writing. More and more I see tools getting in the way of writing. If that wasn’t the case, why do so many tools now add a “focus” or “distraction-free” mode? What choices can I make to simplify my writing ecosystem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer to that, considering the theme of this blog and how I&amp;rsquo;m writing it,  is obvious. But the question is going deeper than that, and so should be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Orgzly: An Interview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.orgzly.com/&#34;&gt;Orgzly&lt;/a&gt; several times on this blog, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t dedicated a full post to it yet until now. Instead of describing my workflow again or just praising Orgzly&amp;rsquo;s usefulness in a repeated manner, I thought it would be interesting to reach out to its creator and ask a couple of questions instead. To my delight, he was happy to reply! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to present my first interview on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Everenote - Behind the Scenes</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/everenote-behind-the-scenes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years back, I was an avid user of Evernote. That was a period of information &amp;ldquo;innocence&amp;rdquo; for me, before I knew much about Linux and switched careers to IT. Back then, Evernote was an amazing discovery. It was the first serious digital (and, to be honest, analog as well) system I built. I remember many nights where I drifted off to sleep thinking about how to tag and achieve my information in it. To this day I have plenty of memories stored away in its achieve files &amp;ndash; though they have been since downloaded and converted from the App&amp;rsquo;s native format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Gcal Failed</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/why-gcal-failed/</link>

      <guid>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/why-gcal-failed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el&#34;&gt;Org-Gcal&lt;/a&gt; a second time just to turn it off again. I was following the (now slightly outdated) &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-26-gcal/&#34;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/&#34;&gt;Mike Zamansky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; blog and managed to get it working this time, but I found the end result messy and cumbersome. This is mostly because of how I use org and my agenda to quickly get a view of what I need, not really a reflection on the tool itself. It made me understand how different the methodology of Google calendar and Org-mode are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Org Capture Templates - Part 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a long unplanned break from writing about my Templates because of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/blogging/css-updates-1/&#34;&gt;CSS changes&lt;/a&gt; I worked on and the complications with Magit. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say these are now behind me, and that I gained another grain of confidence using Magit and knowing git, but this is a post for yet another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the last two templates are rather short, I&amp;rsquo;m putting them both here together. Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Org Capture Templates - Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see part one of this series generated interest on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/agxe8n/my%5Forgmode%5Ftemplates%5Fpart%5Fone%5Fany%5Finterest%5Fin%5Fmore/&#34;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. One of the things I love about Org-mode (and Emacs) is this passion among its user and the thirst to learn more from each other. I believe one of the major reasons for that is Org-mode&amp;rsquo;s complexity: there are so many options, it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be personalized by its users&amp;rsquo; needs. Org-mode is esaily the most personal tool I&amp;rsquo;ve used in a while. Every time I read something Org-mode related somewhere else it&amp;rsquo;s as if I&amp;rsquo;m invited over for a discussion over a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was happy to reply and figured it would be intesting to dig into my capture templates. I started writing this post explaining all of my templates, but then realized I&amp;rsquo;m starting to edit out details because the post is getting too long. So instead, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain each template at a time. Hopefully you find this interesting!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Write Posts for my Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show on this blog (yet), I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging since I got into college, more than a decade ago. Blogging is an activity that combines a couple of passions for me: writing, technology. and visual creativity. My process hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much over the years, and the tools I taught myself to use help me maintaining my routine. This is a quick explanation of its main components.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolvement of Video Journal &amp; Org</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/video-journal-evolved/</link>

      <guid>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/video-journal-evolved/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over time, my videos definitely got smaller. This is because I got used to Org in different areas of recording my thoughts. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarss.github.io/TAONAW/blog/org-update/&#34;&gt;discussed these&lt;/a&gt; couple of times before: tasks, task notes, and journal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agenda, and the Benfit of Having Multiple Files</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/agenda-multiple-files/</link>

      <guid>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/agenda-multiple-files/</guid>
      <description>I used to write all my tasks, personal and work, into one tasks.org file.
On Sunday night, this was good. I had 5 tasks on my list, and I was ready to start my work week. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long (two days actually) for tasks.org to become monster.org. It didn&amp;rsquo;t happen because of the number of tasks, which I kept (more or less) under control. It happened because of the size of the projects I was working on.</description>

      <description>When I write, I live in Emacs (with the awesome Solorized theme) inside Org-Mode.
With time, I found that Org has already made me more effienet writer and note taker. I write notes in every meeting now, rather it&amp;rsquo;s my &amp;ldquo;turn&amp;rdquo; or not. I write notes as I work, about every solution and every problem I&amp;rsquo;m facing. I write first thing in the morning, usually about org-related thoughts I had as I wake up, over a cup of Sumatra cofee (little almond milk, one pack of sugar).</description>
