      <title>Keeping a healthy routine during COVID19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been four months since COVID-19 started for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home, which means far less exercise than usual, especially with gyms closed in the city. Thankfully, I have a system that helps me to keep somewhat active, and today I want to share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you here is going to be groundbreaking. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I picked up bits and pieces of ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve heard in various places and glued them together to something that makes sense to me. Still, or perhaps because of that, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty effective without being too obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-elements&#34;&gt;The Elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in my life, I started basing what I consider to be healthy or wholesome living with the &amp;ldquo;elements&amp;rdquo;. Those are Sleep, Exercise, Nutrition, and Meditation. I believe that if I practice these four disciplines I can remain mostly healthy: mentally and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sleep, my goal is 6.5 hours a night. I often sleep less (my average is about 5.5 hours) so I try to make it up with a nap (20 minutes or so) when possible, usually in the afternoons. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work, but when I take one of these power-naps I&amp;rsquo;m usually able to be healthy afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exercise&amp;rdquo; is an umbrella term for several exercise routines I picked up with the years. The idea, especially during COVID, is to keep things simple. I try to jog around a nearby playground at least once a week (goal is twice), will keeping push-ups, crunches, squats, dips, etc. at home in periods of 10-15 minutes. I try to  include stretches and/or yoga poses as well. This sounds like a lot, but I just do a few of these each time. Keeping up a routine is the single most important thing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for food, I keep things as simple as possible. If a food item has ingredients I don&amp;rsquo;t understand or can&amp;rsquo;t pronounce, I try to stay away from it. Everything today has preservative, stabilizers, acids, and of course, sugar (it&amp;rsquo;s crazy how there&amp;rsquo;s sugar in almost everything!) but I try my best. For example, I choose fresh vegetables where possible over anything frozen, processed, etc. I work in a large medical facility, which makes eating healthier somewhat easier. Water is my main drink of choice, seconded only by coffee and tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most elusive element in the list is meditation. I often struggle to remember to slow down and just breathe. I have a very specific breath technique involving counting which helps. I&amp;rsquo;m pushing to keep a routine of 5 minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-scoring-system&#34;&gt;My Scoring System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scoring system is what makes everything move during COVID-19. It&amp;rsquo;s what keeps me motivated and allows me to improve. Here is how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning I get up, the first thing I do is to make fresh coffee. Then, as its brewing, I go to my journal and write about yesterday&amp;rsquo;s elements. I reflect on what was done and give myself a score. For example, if I do my push-ups, I get 1 point. If I eat home-made salad, that&amp;rsquo;s also a 1. But if I decided to party and have pizza with beer that day, I&amp;rsquo;d give myself a -1. Some things give more points: running is challenging (especially in this heat) so it&amp;rsquo;s worth 3 points, while each set of push-ups is half a point. The system is dynamic and I change it according to what I need to work on. For example, if going to bed at the right time has been working out for a couple of weeks, it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on and get points for, say, taking these power-naps I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, an OK day is 3 points, a good day is 4, an excellent is 5. I try to not go too crazy because too much means the next day or the day after that I will not have the motivation to do much. Aiming at the same rate of 3 or 4 points every day is the main goal for now as a healthy routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fitbit-advantage&#34;&gt;The Fitbit advantage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Fitbit Ionic has never been more useful to me. When I went to the gym before COVID, I&amp;rsquo;d let it detect exercises automatically and never bothered with it too much. Now though, where an opportunity for an exercise means skipping the elevator and taking the stairs, it&amp;rsquo;s really helpful to see when I was active and for how long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ionic is also pretty good at detecting when I fall asleep and for how long. I find that it&amp;rsquo;s accurate within 5-10 minutes. It&amp;rsquo;s useful if you&amp;rsquo;re like me and you need to be dynamic but still have a routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-only-point-is-to-get-better&#34;&gt;The only point is to get better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started picking up on running again I was way behind what I used to be able to do in the past. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even finish a single mile, I was constantly out of breath, and I was very discouraged. The scoring system helps, but only if you use it to reinforce the main goal: to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all you can do is 10 push-ups, then start there. Any good coach on earth would tell you the same. 10 push-ups a day this week means 12 push-ups next week. Whatever you do, is better than doing nothing. That little you do will slowly build up and develop your routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just as hard to go from 10 push-ups to 50 as it is from 200 to 500. That&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s all relative to what you can do. If I score my results honestly, I see I&amp;rsquo;m making progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
