      <title>Benefits of Linux on VM</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20200522/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the majority of work happening from home, I decided to go back to Windows. I was stubborn at start, and continue to host a Windows VM inside Linux, but eventually I acknowledged that I&amp;rsquo;ll a smoother workflow the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, Linux has always been good in vmware&amp;rsquo;s virtual machine. At work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with my SUSE VM for three years to have org-mode next to me. In a VM, the setup process always seems to be smoother than native. A VM also offers snapshots (this is a feature that comes with the non-free workstation option, but can be done indirectly on the free version by simply saving a copy of the VM files)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we go further, how could I ignore my &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/too-many-notifications/&#34;&gt;strong feelings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20191208/&#34;&gt;against Windows&lt;/a&gt;? The short answer is that I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I still dislike all the things I mentioned in Windows. Its still has a pushy, buggy, and undependable update procedure. It still keeps throwing at me a bunch of &amp;ldquo;click me!&amp;rdquo; notifications that often draw float on top of the system tray and block it&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix the updates, I spent an afternoon going through the different &lt;a href=&#34;https://seowsource.com/disable-automatic-updates-using-group-policy-windows-10/&#34;&gt;group policies&lt;/a&gt; and disabling what I could to prevent Windows from messing up my computer without warning. For the notifications, I disabled whatever auto-start applications I could and uninstalled a bunch of junk. I spend my productive time (like writing this post) on the right virtual-desktop full screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware is one of Windows&amp;rsquo; blessings&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I set up a fresh installation of pure Debian with KDE, something I wanted to try before because of Debian&amp;rsquo;s stability. Instead of chasing the bleed edge distros I built Emacs and Hugo to get the latest versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more things my VM offers me I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get from running Linux nativity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping my IP address on the host while using VPN on the guest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounting SMBs for windows managed and shared NTSF drives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitlocker &amp;amp; Powershell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AAA Games that won&amp;rsquo;t run on Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work essentials: VPN, Remote support software, RDP, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that 90% of the things I listed can be made to work with Linux or have a replacement. I could have another VM inside Linux for VPN, for example, or I could try Lutris and Wine (not to mention Steam is running excellent on Linux) for gaming. But it usually requires extra tweaking, and in the end you end up having to contaminate your productivity environment with games and Chromium, which only work to 80%-90% of their potential anyway. I know because that&amp;rsquo;s what kept happening to me. I wanted to use Firefox, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bring all my work-related links from Chrome and my Google profile, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t access those without restarting. I also had to restart every time I wanted to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%5FClancy%27s%5FThe%5FDivision%5F2&#34;&gt;Division 2&lt;/a&gt; with my co-workers. This, in turn, was cutting me off from my other friends on Signal and assessing my org-agenda. In the past, I used a laptop and &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/switching-to-manjaro/&#34;&gt;a KVM switch&lt;/a&gt;, but the laptop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have nearly as much power for ffmpeg tasks and certain things like my gaming keyboard where problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for work, it takes place on a Windows 10 machine which requires a &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; RDP client, Bitlocker, and other applications that run only on Windows. Yes, there are workarounds, but these involved more questions than I care to answer. I don&amp;rsquo;t like nor need extra attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I work at home now, I have my Windows VM roughly occupying a third of my ultra-wide screen, with my work-related websites or remoted-machine to the right. Additional office software that is needed for work is running directly on Windows, next to games and other distractions, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will things stay this way? Who knows. Knowing how I am, I&amp;rsquo;ll get bored 3 months down the line and switch back to some new distro. But that&amp;rsquo;s how I roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When placed at the bottom, the Windows taskbar has more annoyances. I have it set on auto-hide, but when a program requires my attention, it will not go away and often block an important part of the screen. Another issue is confusion between the VM&amp;rsquo;s Linux taskbar and Windows, on top of each other. To fix this, I find that it&amp;rsquo;s better to move the Taskbar out of the way to the right edge of the screen. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware has Fusion for Mac and a Linux version as well. I only have limited experience on an underpowered Mac, where Fusion is impossibly slow, and its Linux version leaves much to be desired, so on Linux I dumped it in favor of Virtuabox. It seems to operate best on Windows. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>The Long Goodbye to Windows</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of switching &amp;ldquo;Completely&amp;rdquo; Linux has been in my head since I wrote
about &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/too-many-notifications/&#34;&gt;having too many notifications&lt;/a&gt; thrown at me whenever I log into Windows&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this entire blog written from Linux? Haven&amp;rsquo;t I already switched to work from Linux? Almost 100% of the posts here concern Emacs, org-mode and Linux. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;d ask me, &amp;ldquo;switch completely? Haven&amp;rsquo;t you already?&amp;rdquo; Yes. Kind of. Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me back off a second, and tell you about Hedwig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedwig, for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical%5Fcreatures%5Fin%5FHarry%5FPotter#Hedwig&#34;&gt;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;s owl&lt;/a&gt;. In the movie series, it is a large snowy owl that delivers Harry his mail. It is an obedient, yet confused owl. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mess, but you learn to like its character and weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/ox-hugo/snow_owl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;above: a snowy owl, straight from the books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My electronic devices (phone, laptop, and desktop) are usually named after the owls from Harry Potter. The Raspberry Pi which syncs all my org-mode files is called Hogwarts; the desktop is Hedwig, the phone is &lt;a href=&#34;https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pigwidgeon&#34;&gt;Pigwidgeon (pig)&lt;/a&gt;, the laptop is &lt;a href=&#34;https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermes&#34;&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;. I am not sure when I came up with this naming scheme, but my liking to owls and Harry Potter clicked some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Hedwig, my Desktop is a large (full tower, soon to be full ATX) machine. It is somewhat &amp;ldquo;confused&amp;rdquo; about certain things, like the time (I replaced a CMOS battery a couple of times), the state of Windows updates (aren&amp;rsquo;t we all), and in general, its identity. Hedwig&amp;rsquo;s been through Windows, Linux (various distros), and even a full Hackintosh at one point. It&amp;rsquo;s the first computer I built completely from ordered parts, the case, motherboard, PSU, CPU, GPU (all the Us), optical and hard drives. This happened about 6 years ago, before I switched careers to IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of December, Hedwig is again a duel-boot machine: Windows and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSUSE&#34;&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt; Linux. I decided to switch to openSUSE from Manjaro (which I use on my laptop) because I&amp;rsquo;ve been using openSUSE at work on my VM and it has been rock-solid; I also grown to like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaST&#34;&gt;YaST&lt;/a&gt; which helps when I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how to change a setting from the command line. The idea is to eventually throw Windows out completely, and interact with it only in a VM on a full Linux machine. This is something I tried to tackle in the past but failed to do in the days before Emacs and Steam on Linux. Now, with my few favorite games available through Steam&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Emacs leaving Windows and Office tools in the dust when it comes to file manipulations and writing, I think I will stay committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am writing these lines on my laptop. Hedwig&amp;rsquo;s fresh Hugo installation, which I use for this blog, is not working yet. This is just one example of many: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jonls/redshift/releases&#34;&gt;Redshift&lt;/a&gt;, Linux&amp;rsquo;s trusted version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://justgetflux.com/&#34;&gt;f.lux&lt;/a&gt; (or nightshift, if you speak Apple), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html&#34;&gt;veracrypt&lt;/a&gt;, which is a cross-platform encryption solution I use daily, and various codecs required to watch videos and compress videos&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with ffmpeg all require special configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustomed to these kinds of workarounds (Manjaro had it&amp;rsquo;s own) on Linux. As much as I love the productivity and stability it brings with it, configuring a machine to work in Linux the way I want it to is never a quick process. In contrast, when I had to restore Hedwig to Windows in the past, all it took was signing into my Microsoft account; withing a minute, all my configurations including the wallpaper was in place. But that&amp;rsquo;s the price you pay for having Microsoft (or Google, or Apple) having a probe up your behind and knowing everything you do. This eerie feeling of &amp;ldquo;we know what&amp;rsquo;s good for you&amp;rdquo; is built into every OS, and exists outside of the technology word alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything fits into nice neat boxes, and so do you, so shut up and move along, I feel they tell me. Even though I find that I have less and less patience for folks who invents &amp;ldquo;new ways&amp;rdquo; and think &amp;ldquo;originally&amp;rdquo; these days, I also have less patience toward those who tell &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to stick to the common ways of doing things. If we are all special none of us is unique, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I find that overall there&amp;rsquo;s little difference in my workflow from Manjaro in openSUSE. Most of my more per-machine tweaks happen in KDE, my preferred desktop environment, and Emacs&amp;rsquo;s file paths which I still can&amp;rsquo;t get to be the same when encrypting (would it kill someone to have the same mounting point for veracrypt in each distro?) Overall, I hope to stick to one distro so I can simply install from a pre-configured backup whenever I need to move to a new computer or a new VM. Using one (or two, one for work and one for home) init files for Emacs would also be great instead of having 5 slightly-different versions floating around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. While this sounds ideal, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;ll ever happen. That&amp;rsquo;s because I find that I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the little differences in how each machine looks and feels. A small XPS running Tumbleweed, openSUSE&amp;rsquo;s rolling release, with white-on-black theme, neon-colored panel with Late and a top panel for system notifications to imitate a Mac like all the cool kids fits, while Hedwig is far more &amp;ldquo;responsible&amp;rdquo; with SUSE&amp;rsquo;s Leap and a traditional black-on-white theme. I need at least a bit of personality on each machine. That&amp;rsquo;s the bit the creative non-conforming dude inside the IT guy in me. Or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m just nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in case you&amp;rsquo;re interested, these four games are currently &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaST&#34;&gt;Cities Skylines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/231430/Company%5Fof%5FHeroes%5F2/&#34;&gt;Company of Heroes 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=oxygen+not+inc&#34;&gt;Oxygen not Included&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest%5FDungeon/&#34;&gt;Darkest Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. Over time (and age, I suppose) I discovered I&amp;rsquo;m less interested in FPSs and more interested in detailed-oriented games. I all-heatedly recommend you take a good long look at Oxygen not Included, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this blog regularly - it&amp;rsquo;s perfect for problem-solvers who are looking to sync into a fun, cute, but very thought-provoking kind of game. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/ffmpeg/comments/e79qv8/maxium%5Fmp4%5Fcompression%5Fonly%5Fin%5Fopensuse/&#34;&gt;I found out&lt;/a&gt;, openSUSE doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html&#34;&gt;libx264&lt;/a&gt;, a codec used to compress videos into mp4 formats. It is so common-place in other distros and programs many (me included) don&amp;rsquo;t even know it exists and does a fantastic job. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Too Many Notifications</title>
      <link>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/too-many-notifications/</link>
      <pubDate>20200-10-10</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/too-many-notifications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fan noise that came from my Windows machine finally got on my nerves, so I turned off my PC. I turned it on the next day, not thinking much about anything, my coffee at hand. As soon as I logged in I was greeted with windows opening on me notifying me on updates, of new games sales, of emails&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;click me! No! Click me!&amp;rdquo; Yeeeesh. I put my coffee down and shut down my Windows PC off again. How did I get to this point again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows allows all kinds of apps to be launched at login (autostart) and throw notifications at you without asking for permission. Because my Windows PC is used for gaming, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic%5FGames%5FStore&#34;&gt;Epic store&lt;/a&gt; announces free new games, and Steam&amp;rsquo;s client keeps updating every few days for whatever reason. NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s updated includes bloatware, wrapping new driver updates with news bulletins I care very little of. Windows itself informs me every time an update is waiting for me to restart, which I do as soon as possible because I don&amp;rsquo;t trust the system to wait for me as it claims to do: if it decides it&amp;rsquo;s time to update then it&amp;rsquo;s time to update, then it&amp;rsquo;s time to update, and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing I can do about it. Even Chrome browser launches automatically with &lt;a href=&#34;https://emby.media/&#34;&gt;Emby&lt;/a&gt;, and with it all the notifications built into Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not new to this and I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised, yet, somehow, this behavior keeps sneaking up on me bit by bit until it&amp;rsquo;s suddenly too much. While Windows is notorious for this kind of behavior, things in Linuxland are also getting out of hand. In particular, Firefox and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect&#34;&gt;KDE-Connect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take WhatsApp for example, which I have to use to communicate with 95% of my friends and family&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s open in Firefox, where it&amp;rsquo;s quick and convenient to type messages while my phone is charging, so Firefox informs me of new messages coming in. My phone, connected by KDE-Connect, also sends notifications. And if I ignore these because I&amp;rsquo;m busy, my Fitbit ionic vibrates on my wrist with yet a third attempt to grab my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all seems annoying and unnecessary as I write this, but during the last two weeks, it was vital. My dad was in the hospital undergoing surgery, and my family members across-seas were talking to each other in a chat room. I wanted to be involved, but not to the point where WhatsApp will show on my browser at work since my privacy (and that of my family) is important to me. Because running around a lot is a normal part of my job I don&amp;rsquo;t always sense the phone vibrating in my pocket. The watch was the best option to be notified. The big hoopla is mostly over now, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to tune it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good example is email. I moved personal emails (family and friends) to Protonmail about a year ago: I wanted to give Google a little bit less info to work with and encrypting communications with important people give me a warm fuzzy feeling. My main money/health/adult-stuff email though is still Gmail, while Outlook has autonomy at the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently use Thunderbird for my Gmail, and I find that the &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of notifications is potentially a problem: if one of my apps happily subscribed me again automatically, I want PayPal to inform me I was just charged. The occasional newsletter from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandcamp&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; is something worth skimming for good new music &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/upgrading-audio-game/&#34;&gt;I re-learned to appreciate&lt;/a&gt;. However, I get no notifications unless Thunderbird is running. This is good because the thought of being notified of &lt;em&gt;every single email&lt;/em&gt; makes me want to puke, but it&amp;rsquo;s all or nothing kind of deal which is not that great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I need to get in there and tailor my notifications to my specific needs, but who has the time to do that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; keep things under control? I know I don&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m on the verge of contaminating my peaceful Linux environment with notification and information overload I don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution for now seems to be in Gmail. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tweaked my filters and labels there in a long time. It should be easy enough to either tame Gmail what&amp;rsquo;s important or at least create an automatic workflow and then worry only about specific labels - these can translate into folders in Thunderbird, and from there, be notified &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; for that folder. I can see this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in Linux information overload is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; choice, not some operating system&amp;rsquo;s default behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communications apps there&amp;rsquo;s not much of a choice: you use what your friends and family use, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. You can sing the praises of Signal or what-have-you as much as you&amp;rsquo;d like, but you&amp;rsquo;d end up talking to yourself. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
