      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of switching &amp;ldquo;Completely&amp;rdquo; Linux has been in my head since I wrote
about &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/too-many-notifications/&#34;&gt;having too many notifications&lt;/a&gt; thrown at me whenever I log into Windows&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this entire blog written from Linux? Haven&amp;rsquo;t I already switched to work from Linux? Almost 100% of the posts here concern Emacs, org-mode and Linux. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;d ask me, &amp;ldquo;switch completely? Haven&amp;rsquo;t you already?&amp;rdquo; Yes. Kind of. Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me back off a second, and tell you about Hedwig.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fan noise that came from my Windows machine finally got on my nerves, so I turned off my PC. I turned it on the next day, not thinking much about anything, my coffee at hand. As soon as I logged in I was greeted with windows opening on me notifying me on updates, of new games sales, of emails&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;click me! No! Click me!&amp;rdquo; Yeeeesh. I put my coffee down and shut down my Windows PC off again. How did I get to this point again?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
