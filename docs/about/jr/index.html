  <h1>Who&#39;s JR</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-10-07T14:22:27-0400 class="post-date">Sun, Oct 7, 2018</time>
  <p>Josh Rollins is one persistent bastard who was told by his teacher he would never be a writer, so naturally, he had to prove him wrong. Later, he was told by his supervisor he will never make a good IT guy, so he had to prove him wrong, too.</p>

<p>As a non-native New Yorker, he cares too much about living in the city to lead a normal life, which is a good thing, because he has no idea what the word even means.</p>

<p>JR has been writing about sex, tech, and the many things in between for years. He recently woke up from daily grind induced coma. A polyamorist, privacy geek, and a wannabe health nut, he keeps littering the internet with his personal opinions and how-tos about all sorts of stuff mentioned above.</p>
