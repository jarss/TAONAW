 When I write, I live in Emacs (with the awesome [[https://github.com/altercation/solarized][Solorized]] theme)
 inside Org-Mode. 

 With time, I found that Org has already made me more effienet writer
 and note taker. I write notes in every meeting now, rather it's my
 "turn" or not. I write notes as I work, about every solution and every
 problem I'm facing. I write first thing in the morning, usually about
 org-related thoughts I had as I wake up, over a cup of Sumatra cofee
 (little almond milk, one pack of sugar). Quite honestly, Org makes me
 /feel/ good, because it's transparent. It's an extensions of my
 thoughts, continuing on one long line, uninterrupted, before I stop to
 think a second and relfect one what I was thinking (=X-q=).

 There's no pretending in Org. No fancy text, fonts, or even
 images. Style is only applied to function. It's a delicate balance
 which, with the Solirized theme, work extremly well (by the way, the
 [[http://observer.com/2015/02/meet-the-man-behind-solarized-the-most-important-color-scheme-in-computer-history/][story of the man who created Solorized]] is quite interesting and worth
 reading). There's also an inviting segue here about Linux, which is
 the Org-writing mindset extended into an operating system. But I'm
 joyfully digress.

 Alright then. But every now on then you need to present stuff, and
 this means you need to "dress up" so other people can talk to you and
 relate. The "Normals," so to speak, do not understand my Org
 dedication and often give me concerned looks when I type away, a
 single long line into a blank screen. The purity is empty, the lack of
 buttons and distracting elements feels threatening withough GUI
 guidance. Fine then, I can do fancy schmancy.

 Most Org-folk I've read and listened to talk about LaTex. In my case,
 that meant a full installation, which is huge. Over 2GB huge. Not
 worth it for concessional usage, especially since I work in Microsoft
 environment at work, and most people I'll share with will need .docx
 or .ppt format anyway. So for me, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument][.odt]] seems like a better answer.

 Two things are needed on my Emacs (version 25.2.1) for that: 

 1. *Download and install Libre Office*. It comes built in with many
    personal desktop-geared Ubuntu distros, but in my version (Mint) I
    chose to opt out at start. OK, not biggie, full Libre office suite
    is only 100MB, and I can do that. I see myself edit the
    concessional Word file or producing a PDF.

 2. *Add the following* to .emacs to turn on .odt option in the export
    dispatcher:
  
   ~`(eval-after-load "org"
   '(require 'ox-odt nil t))`~


 Now I can create the .dot file, which I can open in Libre Writer I
 just downloaded. Ooof. Hello GUI word proccessing, with weird paper
 screen restrictions look. And the white, the white! It burnsss
 usss.... But anyway. Overall things look excellent, but if I want to
 change fonts, move around images etc, now I can in a more eyecandy
 format without leaving Linux. Then again, if I really need to produce
 a document, I might as well save my .odt in Writer to a .docx and
 remote remote into my work computer, where Mirosoft reigns
 supreme. Options. We like having them, yes?

 Even another option I was considering is to use [[https://typora.io/][Typora]], which is a
 pretty markdown writer. It comes with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc][Pandoc]], and can handle Word and
 PDF files. Typora does not exactly feel "Linux free" to me and seems
 heavily inspired by different "minimalist" Mac word processing apps,
 if that's your thing. It probably won't show in your distro's and
 require installation from a ppa. I used Typora for a while for
 markdown, but we've parted ways now.

 I'm curious how this will stand out when I present my notes (since
 I've became the unofficial note taker at work, for reasons mentioned
 above). But for now, I'm more than happy to take off the fancy clothes
 and slide back to my comfortable t-shirt and shorts and write in Org. 

*** PUBLISHED Agenda, and the Benfit of Having Multiple Files       :orgmode:

    I used to write all my tasks, personal and work, into one tasks.org
    file.

    On Sunday night, this was good. I had 5 tasks on my list, and I was
    ready to start my work week. But it didn't take long (two days
    actually) for tasks.org to become monster.org. It didn't happen
    because of the number of tasks, which I kept (more or less) under
    control. It happened because of the size of the projects I was
    working on. Setting up computers, encryption, and even elementary
    personal stuff like paying my bills; each task naturally grew to
    sub-tasks, and those in turn had their own notes and lists.

    My initial solution to that was to create a "Details" heading for
    the projects. It contained time rangers I worked on a project
    (entered manually), and links to other sources I needed. This kept
    extra information out of the way when I didn't need it. This caused
    two issues. First, I now had "Details" showing on my agenda, since
    my time-range was directly under that header. Second, things
    quickly got out of control on my Android phone with Orgzly. That's
    because Orgzly does not fold seondary headings. I had to deal with
    walls of texts which I had to scroll through before I got to the most
    recent ToDo items.
   
    As I was scratching my head at this, work and life continued. My
    tasks list grew each day - No, each couple of hours. Interruptions
    kept coming in, obscure urgent new projects oppoped up while older
    ones from previous weeks resurfaced. My list was quickly overtaken
    by work stuff, while personal projects remained in the background,
    often pushed down the list and out of view.
   
    Realizing that I can't handle just viewing my tasks.org on my phone
    anymore (toward the end of the week, I could barely do it even in
    Emacs) I started using the tool I should have used more from the
    beginning: The agenda.

**** The Agenda

    The agenda view changed everything. Opened from everywhere with a
    quick key combo, it enabled me to see everything that I need to
    do. This is thanks to one thing that survived through the mess was
    my method of /scheduling/ assignments I intended to work on that
    day or in the next couple of hours. I picked this habit from one of
    the old Org tutorials floating around, which I cannot find right
    now. Scheduling means I still had a wall of ToDo items in
    tasks.org, but I only scheduled up to 5 things I intended to work
    on. I am only human, after all. Scheduling showed me what I wanted
    to do, and ToDo keywords showed me assignments that I haven't yet
    scheduled, but need to at some point. I could view both
    comfortably from the agenda view with =C-c a n=.
   
    This proved to be effective not only in Emacs, but also in Orgzly,
    on my phone. Thanks to the "Scheduled" search, I now also have a
    widget on my homescreen, an affective todo list. There's even a
    check button to check off Items on this widget, which marks them as
    "done." Orgzly also does a good job at creating customized
    searches, so that I can specifically see what is scheduled for
    today vs what is scheduled for the next 3 days, or week. I can have
    another filter showing me my unscheduled ToDos as well, in case I
    want to start working on them. What a wonderful thing.

 # Phone Screenshot here! 

    Working with the agenda, I realized I'm faster than before. At
    work, the first thing I do after I launch Emacs is to get into
    agenda view. From there, it is much faster to "tab in" to whatever
    task I need. This replaced my need for =C-x C-r=, recentf,
    since now I was not only in the file I need, but also in the
    /section/ I need. Even better: =C-x n s= can be used then to "zoom
    in" to the task at hand, blocking out the long list of other items. 
   
    In agenda, I was also able to quickly see tags and categories, edit
    properties, and most importantly, quickly schedule ToDos. As the
    agenda became my bread and butter, another small issue surfaced:
    the category property. Since I still used one file, I used the category
    property to differentiate between personal and work tasks. On the
    agenda, each schedule task was placed in a "Tasks" category by
    default, since that was the file I was using. Even when I did
    assigned a category from the agenda, I still had to do so for a child
    header (I thought these are supposed to be inharied, but this
    didn't seem to work). This may sound like aesthetics, but being
    able to filter out all personal/work tasks can be very handy. 
   
    I was also thinking of my issue of having multiple values for one
    property. This was a problem I was trying to solve for the last
    several weeks. As an example, consider a task of setting up several
    computers, where extra information such as serial numbers and
    models is needed. Up to that point, I had a header nested inside my
    task.org file, like "set up 4 computers." I used the custom
    property =:Serials:= followed by the serial numbers for set-up
    tasks: =:Serials: 1111 2222 3333 4444= etc. This didnt' work well,
    since Org considered the /whole/ thing, including spaces, as the
    value of the property "Serials." I could still search, using Swiper
    (Ivy is one of the first things I install), for the serial as text,
    but anything that has to do with properties as functions did not
    work. I asked about this in reddit and in IRC several times, but
    could not find a satisfactory solution to breaking down properties
    that way. Someone, at one point, offered a rather complicated
    function -- but I kept feeling this was a too common of an issue to
    be overlooked like that. Something more fundemental was off in the
    way I was working with Org, but I didn't know what it was. So I
    decided to "go back" and reflect again on how Org was meant to work
    originally.
   
    After re-reading some sections of the manual and watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoJTwQvgfgMM#t%3D1m20s][Carsten
    Dominik's]] presentation back from 2008, I was reminded of Org-modes
    original built-in tools. In the lecture, Carsten emphasized [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-view.html][Column
    View]] in Org. It is something I saw in passing previously, but now
    that I was having a mess on my hands with properties, Column View
    glowed in a welcoming aura. A quick and efficient way to have a
    table of the computers' serial numbers (or users, or model...)
    right next to the header, in a comfortable layout? I needed this. I
    could set columns per header, if I wanted to, which meant more
    fiddling around with the specific laptop-setup task in my old
    method. Or... I could just have a set-up dedicated org file which will
    already have the column view for laptop-set up built in with the
    properties... Wait a minute.

**** Using Multiple Org Files

    That was it. Everything I learned to this point came together in a
    torrent of thoughts. The solution to the properties problem was to
    have dedicated org files for each big project. After all, that's
    /exactly/ what the agenda was made for: to be used as the "glue"
    between them. This was why I was supposed to use agenda in the
    first place! As long as I had a task scheduled, it didn't matter
    what file it was in. All I need to do is to tab in, just like I did
    with tasks.org. The idea of having a list of tasks in one file was
    so ingrained in my head from all the apps I used in the past, I was
    blind to see what was under my nose.

    With the realization of needing to break tasks back to different
    files came the realization that I am probably squeezing too much
    data into one org file. After all, setting up laptops as a task is
    a /project/ in itself. It should include a heading for /each/
    laptop, along with a checklist of steps I do for each, with a log
    describing different issues I am having in the process. From the
    agenda, this looks just like another project I do during the week.
    it fits inside the tasks list and on my phone just the
    same. 
   
    I was in for another pleasent surprise: In my agenda, since now I
    seperated the setups to a different file, my category problem
    suddenly disappeared as well. All my laptop setups were shown as
    "setups" as a category, because this is the file they are
    in. Wow. So this is what happens when you stop fighting something and
    start using it the way it was meant to be used. 

**** Next Steps

 I've been using the system above for almost a week now (this post has
 been a week in the making). Here are some ideas about what's next.

 1. +adoptive capture template for tickets+ this was done this morning!  I
    now have a capture template that automatically prompts me for the
    properties needed for each ticket I need to work on. It is then filed
    as a ToDo task in my weekly "tasks.org"
 2. Should Figure out what to use tags for: work in progress. While categories
    have their place, tags are more fluid. For now, it seems like I'm
    gravitating toward creating "mind keywords" of certain topics or
    terms that I'm familiar with. These, in turn, should be good for
    searches since I think in these terms when I'm looking for
    something. For example, a task flagged with my boss's name tells me
    this is a task he's viewing actively, or a "wiki" tag tells me
    there's some good info stored in the notes of the tasks that I
    should probably store for later.
 3. Learn to trust the system. It's /hard/ to let myself create tasks
    in different files. I still need my weekly "mind-dump" of a place
    where I throw in quick captures and tasks that are not big enough
    for their own file, but I should stop thinking of it as my weekly
    list of things I'm doing, since it's misleading. The agenda is what
    reflects that now.

I asked my coworkers the following question: 
 "What is the one truth, in a sentence, you've learned from being in a help desk position"? Here are the answers. 

 #+hugo: more

 *Chris (age:25, years in the job:3)*: "There are a lot, and I mean a /lot/, stupid people in the world." 

 *Nick (age:28, years in the job:10)*: "You got to have a lot of patience" 

 *Dave (age:63, years in the job:30)*: "You're only as good as the last person you've helped" 

 *Myself (years in the job:3)*: "If it was really to 'just work', we'd be out of a job"

 When looking at the nature of the job and the experience each one of us had, these facts make a lot of sense. 

 Chris is the youngest, very bright, and after money. He's tired of users forgetting to check the power cable or not knowing how to reset their computers before calling. Nick is a chill guy who never seems to get upset. He is used to the boss demanding things and he exercises every day, which definitely help to take out aggravations. Dave has seen it all in this job and been through a couple of management changes. His other favorite sentence is "tomorrow is another day."

Having a consisted, stable server for my org files has been on my mind for a while. I bought a Raspberry PI (RP) to serve as a file server to be used as a "hub" that will always be on and host these files. This is a description of the setup of what I've done to make this work. I hope you'd find this useful! Feel free to contact me with any questions. 

#+hugo: more

**** Buying the Raspberry Pi. 

 For the setup I describe here, you need the RP itself, a power source, an SD card, a USB case for 2.5 inch HDD, and the HDD itself. You'll also need an Ethernet cord for this setup. If you don't have one, go grab yourself a [[https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-RJ45-Cat-6-Ethernet-Patch-Cable-5-Feet-1-5-Meters/dp/B00N2VILDM/ref=lp_9938478011_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1542991619&sr=1-1][CAT6 cord Amazon Basics]] cable, it's always good to have one around.  

 For the RP, you better off getting a package similar to [[https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01C6Q2GSY/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1541986065&sr=1-2-fkmr0&keywords=canakit+raspberry+pi+3+b%252B+sd+card][this one]]. You could probably get something slightly cheaper by getting all the parts yourself, but not by much. Better to have everything you need at once without worrying about forgetting something. I didn't get the above package with the SD card, so I had to wait a couple of days for another order to come in. 

 The HDD I had laying around already, so I got [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M08LCXW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][this case]] for it. 8 bucks. 

**** Setting up the RP

 First, we're going to set up the SD card to run our RP. 

 Before we jump in, a note about my setup: I have Linux in a VM inside a Windows host. As it turns out, having Windows an alt-tab away (or in my case, ctrl+alt+left arrow away) can be very useful. 

 If switch between Windows programs and Linux commands without mentioning it, that's because this setup comes naturally to me at this point. I've been working this way (office and home) for almost four years, minusaa half a year of dual-booting with Linux-Mint as my daily OS. There's a whole story here about the switch to Linux and back, but that's for another time. 

 OK! Enough chatter. Let's get on with it.  

  1. Download [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/][Raspbian]] (zip file).
  2. Format the SD to FAT32
  3. Unzip, and write the image to the SD using [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/][Win32 diskimager]] or Underbootin. For me, the first option is better when I deal with SD cards and my USB-SD adapter, YMMV. 
  4. Create an empty file (no extension) on the SD root called SSH. 

 That last part is important. Creating the file (in windows, just create a new text file, rename to SSH and delete the extension) is what tells our RP to open port 22 for SSH.

 Then you insert the SD card and power the RP up. Log into your router to find the RP's IP address.  This is why you need to Ethernet connection for. You won't be able to access the RP with WiFi for this.

 Go ahead and SSH into the RP as pi: =ssh pi@[RP IP address here]=. your default password is raspberry. 

 Once in, you want to sudo into  RP config tool: =sudo raspi-config=. The setup tool is straightforward enough, but I found that remoting into the pi itself with VNC (coming up) is more convenient, so the only option we really care about now is to turn VNC on: 
 go to interface options (option 5 in my case, in the middle), and do that. 

 Save, get out, and then download [[https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/vnc/linux/][RealVNC]]. I downloaded it for Linux because that's what I use to SSH and setup my Pi. It's also where later I will setup Syncthing (coming up), so it made sense. RealVNC is the recommended option for RPs. it's easy to install and run, and supports VNCing with a password, which is what you need for the RP. As a bonus, it automatically creates nice thumbnails of the last logins (IP addresses) which can be useful.

 With RealVNC, go ahead and connect to the RP using the same IP address and default password. The Raspbian will jump on you right away telling you need to change your default password and a bunch of other things. and that's all good. Follow these screens, and after updates are downloaded, /don't/ restart just yet. 

 You might have noticed you're working in a tiny little screen. Let's change that quickly by going to the preferences (click on the RP icon at the top left), then Raspberry Pi Configurations. Under resolution, choose something that works well for you. for my ultra wide screen, 1920x1080 was good enough to work in. Now you can restart. If you changed your password (you should have!) leave RealVNC on and it will inform you the password is wrong (because you changed it). All good, log in. 

**** A note about passwords and password generators

If you use a password manager (my favorite on Linux now is xpass, LastPass is another), I strongly recommend to copy-paste your password in plaintext somewhere first, then copy it to the RP password-change field, and click the eye icon to reveal it. /Make sure what you pasted is the same thing you think you pasted/. In my case, I messed this up twice and had to image my SD card all over again. Yes, [[https://howtoraspberrypi.com/recover-password-raspberry-pi/][there's a technique to reset up the password by booting into the root shell]], but this didn't work for me. And besides, it's annoying and requires to physically connect a screen and keyboard to the RP. 

Because my RP is set up for SSH with a password for now, I made a random 32 character password for it. copy-paste is not a choice. 

**** Encrypting the HDD

I chose to use a separate HDD for a couple of reasons: 

1. I can take it with me if I need to and mount to another machine
2. I have unused HDDs laying around from computer repairs. In my case, the HDD is 500GB, more than enough for text files and occasional pictures I use in Org-mode.
3. If the HDD dies, I still have a functional RP with the OS on the SD card. 

The encryption tool of choice for me ended up being LUKS, the same thing that encrypts Linux machines at startup. Actually, my first choice was [[https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html][VeryCrypt]]. It comes with a convenient GUI and better options to handle containers. As it turns out, there's no updated version for ARM (which is what the RP is), and I'd have to compile from source. Possible, but not worth it for now.

VNC into your RP.

1. First, Install cryptsetup on the RP (apt-get). This is the LUKS suite.
2. Figure out the USB-connected drive: =sudo fdisk -l=. this will show you where's your hdd in /dev. In my case, it was in /dev/sda (not sda1, etc.) 
3. Format with LUKS:  =cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/[drive]= the default option was fine for me, but be aware that LUKS comes with many options if you so desire. When formatting, it should ask for a passphrase, so give it one. Then it should start doing its thing.
4. When done, verify your drive is encrypted with  =cryptsetup luksDump /dev/[drive]=. You should see information about the encryption, along with the first key (LUKS can hold up to eight keys) and its hash. This means we're all good so far. 
5. Now, create a mount point for your drive. for me, out of habit of using Mint, that was /media/pimount. So: =sudo mkdir /media/pimount=. 
6. This is where things get a bit hazy since I'm writing this from memory. We need to open the encrypted drive with =cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mapper/[drive name] [mounting point name]=. Notice we have *mapper* in the path after dev now. that's how LUKS work. The encryption is not being done on /dev/[drive] itself. I'm not sure why (I'm sure there's some Linux file system reason behind it), so feel free to educate me.
7. Now, we need to format the drive with the file system of our choice. In my case, ext4. I believe this can also be done for FAT32 or even NTFS if you want to access your drive from Windows, but I haven't tested that. To format, you can download Gparted, which is good to have in general. However, this is easy to do with =mkfs.ext4 /dev/[name]=. In fact, that's exactly what Gparted would do for you anyway.
8. Mount the freshly formatted drive: =mount /dev/mapper/[name] /media/[name]=  If we have "show mounted drives" option on the desktop in RP, it should show now. As a matter of fact, it's a good idea to enable this (right click on the RP desktop). 

Before you start putting stuff on your HDD, it's a good idea to restart and practice mounting the drive again (step 6 and 8; you don't need to format again!). Then do it again. The unmount command is umount (no n), or you can simply restart the Pi.  There's a way to automate this using fstab, but messing your fstab could screw up your RP as it happened to me. I figured I never plan on really turning off the thing, so I will just keep doing it manually. Now, if someone happens to just grab your HDD and walk away, it will need to be mounter and decrypted. 

**** Syncthing setup

To me, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncthing][Syncthing]] is the best solution for all my file-syncing needs. It works without a hitch until you need to change something tiny and meaningless. Then all hell breaks loose. I don't understand why that is, but I learned to accept it as a fact of life at this point. 

During this RP weekend setup, I had to change my Syncthing setup so that the RP will become the central hub. What happened was a fruitless night of trying to figure out why Syncthing stopped syncing and  an messy Monday at work. It was such a bad setback, in fact, that I decided to create a process dubbed "downfall" for future cases just like this one when I can't use Org-mode at work. Yes, not having Syncthing basically means I can't use Org. But I digress... The important lesson here is this: 

don't mess with Syncthing. Set it up, make sure it works, and /don't touch it/. 

As intimidating as this sounds, Syncthing actually has a pretty simple setup process. Here's the plan: 

[[file:static/hub.png]]

The different colors represent the different folders in syncthing. To me these are personal, work, utilities (this is the only folder that does not have org files), and archive. 

I use four devices, three daily, one (laptop) once in a while. The home VM, which is my main productivity box, gets everything. So does the laptop, it's meant to be used as my home away from home. My work VM (OpenSuse Linux) only contains work org files and the archive. On the phone, I skip media-heavy folders like DnD and some classical music flac files to save space. 

The setup process:

1. Install Syncthing on RP (apt-get). 
2. Choose the first device to sync. Add the RP's ID to its Syncthing.
3. /Wait/ for RP to acknowledge the device. Approve.
4. From the connecting device, share the folders you want to sync with the RP.
5. /Wait/ for RP to acknowledge folders. Approve each, choose path.
6. Verify the sync work by altering the files a bit.
7. Choose the second device to sync... repeat step 3-5.

Now, folders that common to a couple of devices should be added first from one device (as stated above) with the RP, and then add that folder to the /other/ device. Device_A --> RP --> Device_B. This ensures you're sharing the same folder (same folder ID) and not creating duplicates. The reason you're doing it this way and not just sharing from one device to another is because you don't want the other devices to see each other; they should only "see" the RP. The RP is the only device that needs to see all of them. Fewer complications means Syncthing works better and faster. Remember what I said earlier: don't play with it, keep it simple and it will work. Complicate it, and you'll spend hours trying to figure out what's wrong.  

So for example, if I first sync my home VM and share the "work" folder to the RP, after I'm done and verify the sync work, I am connecting the work VM to the RP, wait until it's recognized, and then send the work folder (which is now synced between home VM and RP) /to/ the work VM.

Most chances are, you won't even hear about Secure Token unless you happen to manage Macs for your company. Secure Token seems to be only an issue with Active Directory.

#+hugo:more

Because Apple doesn't talk much about Secure Token, I suggest you read about it on [[https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/secure-token-and-filevault-on-apple-file-system/][Der Flounder]]. There's a pretty good explanation of what it does and why. 

My story begins with the delivery of an iMac. It usually takes me 1.5 hours to prep a Mac from start to finish since we don't have a working image yet; that's a whole issue in itself. The prepped iMac gets to the user bound to the domain so all they have to do is log in. I then connect them to their user's share drive (as a startup item so they always have it) and see if they need access to any printers that we don't have on the server, There is usually at least one. 

I have to log in first (as the iMac's admin) to unlock FileVault. So far, so good. Then, using the fast switching menu, I get back to the login screen and ask the user to log in using their domain credentials. On AFPS, like the one here, I get the Security Token window. Mo problem. I put in the admin credentials, the user is approved, and after adding said printers and share drive, we restart to make sure everything is in working order. 

Last week though, it didn't. 

The user that I just authenticated was not on the login screen. My admin account was there, my test account was there, his account... nope. This was odd since I knew we just went through authenticated with the secure token. I logged into my admin account and check the security settings since I know it will tell me if anyone is not allowed to log in because of FileVault... but nothing. I ran =fdesetup list=, which shows the list of approved FileVault users, and sure enough, he was there. 

In the next couple of days, I've had a couple of users log into this iMac to test. I also had the user log into a different iMac, one that I set up a week previously using the exact same procedure. Everyone could sign in and /stay/ approved (they'd show up after approved with the secure token and restart) on the iMac besides this one person. On the other iMac, we ran into the same issue with this user. The problem then was with the account. 

Because I saw the user log in and out so many times and checked the users list, I noticed something odd: the user's name was omitted. There was nothing at the top right corner (fast switching) and in the list of users, the icon for a user showed up without a name. I've never seen anything like that before on a mac.

Back at my desk I looked into the account and couldn't find anything odd at first. I even copied the account to create another test user... and then I saw it: the Display Name field for that user was blank for some reason. The Display Name field in AD is populated automatically when a new user is created, but not here. 

Today I managed to do final testing. I repeated the same test: signed in with admin, gave my test user with the blank Display Name field access with secure token, and restarted. Sure enough, the test user could not be seen on the login screen. Only after my admin account was signed in the test user was able to sign in as well. 

As soon as I populated the Display Name field and logged in again, everything worked. The name showed up, and the secure token remained. 

The conclusion: macOS pulls the user's name field from "Display Name" in AD. And it /needs/ this name for the secure token. Without it, it doesn't work. the secure token is tied to the display name of the user, not the user account itself... or at least, not completely.

When someone asks what we install on their personal devices (BYOD laptops), I usually give them the abridged version. People rarely care about details. Every now and then though, someone is a bit concerned and asks for more information. Stuff like why do we need software that tells us details about their hardware, how do we use it, and of course, if we can view their personal data. My answer to that last question is "we can if we want to." It bothers me this question comes only from so few individuals.

#+hugo:more

A few days ago, A client gave me her under-performing BYOD laptop for general cleanup before switching it back for strictly personal use. She knew about the different bits of software we install because she asked me when she first brought it in. She was curious and worried about her privacy and she got the full story from me. I have no doubt that the conversation was motivating enough for her to come back for a cleanup -- and for the right reasons. I dare hope that she sought me out specifically to clean her laptop because she trusted me a bit more after that conversation.  

How many people leave us with their personal laptop without ever bothering checking in with us to make sure our software is removed? A few of them will take the time to wipe their laptops, but so many more, the majority for sure, will never bother.  

Among our most intrusive software is an Anti Virus client that dials home to our management environment and an inventory management software that gives us full details about the hardware and software installed on the device. We also effectively have root privileges on BYOD devices, basically a backdoor on their system.  

There's nothing unique about what we do. The same practices are followed by virtually every respectful IT company that deals with BYODs. Nothing we do have sinister intentions, and I trust everyone on my team not to abuse root privileges on BYOD devices which are often one of the most personal things a person owns. But that doesn't mean our clients should just trust us blindly.

    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 5months
    :EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2018-12-17:
    :END:

 According to my notes, I started using Org seriously mid August of this years. I was thinking it will be interesting to see what I learned and where I am today. 

**** Beginnings: costumizing Org and journaling

 At the beginning, my main concerns were regarding wokring with Org the way I used to previously, and journaling. Before using Org and Emacs, I used [[https://typora.io/][Typora]], which I still think is one of the best tools I've seen to writing Markdown. It was a minimalist and pretty application which I enjoyed writing my journal notes in. I tried to copy this experience into Emacs, but of course, Org comes with many organizational options Typora is not desgined to  have. 

 It took some time to get used to letting Org dealing with dates and then eventually shift to its date format (I used to write dates and times without hyphens, like 20180101:1521). I then took a nautral turn to start my transformation into a weekly mindset with org. I always prefered to work in a weekly mindset and journaled about my week going back, but now I also started to organized my todos this way and slowly started counting on my Aenda rather then just an org file for work and for personal life. This is how I stayed until today. 

**** Improving Technical Skills

Using Emacs meant looking into some techical elements that I was familair yet not comfortable with. To make Emacs mine, I had to dig deeper into its init file, learn to use org-capture, set up and use my computer as SSH server for TRAMP, and eventually, create a VM at work. All the above skills were needed to make Org mode useful for me at work, which I knew from the beginning would be the big test. 

***** Init into Org: 

The Emacs init file still looks somewhat alien and hostile to me without comments explaining what exactly each snippet of code does. Only when I shifted to Org, a task which took at least two weekends, I started being more comfortable with changing parts of my settings for different computers. This, in turn, is what allowed me to work on Emacs from a dedicated VM at work. 

Different things in my org  settings, such as the capture templates, are revisted for minior tweaks with relative ease which was not possible within the inital init file for me. I had to explain terms in my own way, not the Emacs way, to really "get it". 

***** Org Capture

**** Going down from 50 to 20 tickets

It was a Wednesday, and I was wondering how I cut down about half of my tickets in two days. The week started out with abotu 50 tickets, and I was now looking at 26 that were still active. Even though usually I hope to leave my desk for the weekend with no more than 20 active tickets, the most that would show on one page without clicking "next", this was definitely progress in the right direction.   

**** What helped, and why

There were a couple of helpful factors since Monday that I wanted to note for myself. 

First, management hired a temp who worked with us before. The guy was not only fast and hard-working, he also had a general understanding of our environment. It wasn't his knowledge that helped the most (though, it definitely came in handy), but the fact that he served as a "buffer" between us and the "fires" managment and customers had us take over. We all have rules we learn through our jobs, and in my case the rule is "it's never as simple as at looks." Basically, it means that if I'm dragged out of my dask for some rudimentary task, I'm going to spend 90% of the time getting to the root of the problem and 10% to fix the issue itself. 

Second, also thanks to the temp, I had someone to send to "probe" an existing task. It is often the case that a customer doesn't respond back, either allowing us to close the task as complete or get back to us with more necessary details, like you know, which computer out of our fleet has an issue. That alone allowed me to close around 10 tasks that were duplicates of others or were just hanging in the air with a question mark. 

Third, bigger boss was out, which means less pressure or boss to give side tasks. With no new projects, I was able to focus on my present issues dig out many stale incidents. 

Fourth, my other co-worker who had the second biggest queue was back in office and able to attend to tickets. This usually doesn't affect me as much because I don't cover his cases (unless its an emergency), but then again, it does. 

Fifth, Org-mode was working beatifully after my [[https://joshrollinswrites.com/techden/raspberry_pi_org_hub/][Pi setup]]. Everything I changed on my work VM synced beatifully to my home VM without issues, and my personal files (which include my wiki and journal, both of which I use at work) where accessible even though my home desktop was behind a VPN that blocks SSH. That's because my Pi is the only device now accessible to the outside world.  

**** How does Org help (mgt doesn't get it)

Org mode has long become my pillar of stability in an highly hectic environment. This is a repeated theme in this blog, I realize. This week is yet another fine example of working by my own order of things. With Org, I have an agenda that goes from hour to hour, from day to day. I know what ticket I need to look at before lunch, which incident needs a review before I leave for the day. I have titles that make sense to me the next day when I come in, and details that tell me exactly where I left off and what I should do next. With org, I have both personal and work related issue written down with me wherever I go, so my priorites are really /my/ priorities. 

I often think that a good manager should know how to align work priorties with that of his workers, not /force/ them. An excellent manager should be able to help train his workers to work like soliders in the battlefield. Each solider is obident and works according to instructions, but at the same time, can function completely independently if needs be. It's the opposite of micromanagment which freezes employees in their track without managment intevention and oftne give up and go home. 

This last part if what org is to me. It is my personal order of functions and my how-tos. At first glance, it looks like I'm giving myself extra work by copying every active issue over to this seemingly archaic text-only system. The truth is of course, that once it's in my system, I can follow through with it to completion with all the information I need available to me at all times, even after work hours. That, in my opinion, what makes me more productive than a mindless drone.

I've been using LastPass for the last 5 years and been happy with it. I recommended it to friends, family, and co-workers. I tried to sell it through its convenience: once set up, LastPass auto-fills user and password fields, and can even log you into a website directly. LastPass also creates complicated passwords automatically and is available on every major browser, iPhones and Android.  

But it seems like even LastPass's time has come.

#+hugo: more 

As we know, Convenience usually comes at the price of security. LastPass auto-fill is quick and effective but also makes it very easy for someone else to grab your laptop, find your bank website in your history, and log int with your saved credentials.  To resolve this issue, LastPass has a couple of built-in options such as logging you out after a certain amount of time or logging off when the browser is closed. There features need to be activated on each new installation of LastPass. 

So LastPass was an obvious choice for my mom's new chromebook. I thought I'd set her up with a new account and share passwords with her directly. I wanted her to learn to trust the app and starts creating new secure passwords instead of using the same two or three she's been using for years. But instead, I discovered a problem.  there were problems. 

The option to log off automatically if chrome is closed was ignored. I've checked and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Lastpass/comments/aozro2/lastpass_auto_logout_doesnt_work_out_on/][asked other users on Reddit]], but all I got is the [[https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=3846][generic troubleshooting advice]] to make sure Chrome completely exists for the auto logoff to work. Exiting Chrome is possible on Windows, Mac, and Linux (for which this guide was written) but, as it turned out, is /not/ possible on a Chromebook. I [[https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/6309225?hl=en][summoned the ChromeOS task manager]] with =shift+esc= or more recently =search+esc= (this is different than the Chrome browser's task manager, which is accessible from inside Chrome) and saw that Chrome was still running even after I exited the app. I couldn't force chrome to quit either: The button to do so was grayed out when I had Chrome highlighted on the list.

That meant that the only thing protecting someone from accessing all your passwords is your Google Password with lockscreen enabled. Perhaps i'm paranoid, but for me, that's not nearly enough. I disabled the extension and asked myself these two questions:

1. Is it worth using LastPass over Chrome's built in password manger? 
2. Is LastPass really a good option to securely save passwords?

The the first answer is "not really." If you're a LastPass power user, who have the application on your phone and use a family plan (which allows you to share passwords), then yes, LastPass gives you more features. However, Chrome's Password Manager now allows you to create secure passwords and sync them with your Google Profile, which means you will have access to those anywhere you log in including your Phone. Since on a Chromebook your security is already handled by Google, there's not much sense to start a new account with LastPass, which basically does the same thing. 

The second question is harder to answer. LastPass is a company that makes its business to secure passwords all day every day, and they have a great product. They are, overall, pretty transparent with their security breaches when they happen and apply patches and fixes very fast. 

However, LastPass' browser extension is also its weakest point. To be fair, the same can be said for /any/ password manager that has an extension built into the browser. Various vulnerabilities have been listed before and [[https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=11012][some were listed by LastPass]] themselves. If you're really concerned about the security of your passwords, you should not use a browser extension. However,if I am hard-pressed between choosing Chrome's built in password solution and a third party's solution that is built into Chrome, I will go with Chrome's built-in solution because it's native to the application and hence (hopefully) more secure. 

But. The real answer here is that you shouldn't use a browser extension /at all/. And that's what I do these days.

My favorite solution is to use good ol' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass][KeyPass]], which has been around for about 15 years. I like KeyPass for a couple of reasons: 

1. It's a standalone program with  a simple GUI and flexibility. It works and looks better than LastPass's more complicated controls and does not relay on cookies.
2. The only person with my passwords is me, which makes me sleep better at night. This has been my general trend since I started using Linux. It's not about privacy and less about security, a proud feeling of owning my on data, something I feel we don't do enough these days.
3. KeyPass is old, open sourced, free, and probably not going anywhere. I'd like to say the same thing about LastPass, but companies such as these are constantly get eaten by greedy corporation that inject them with crap like social network integration and ads.
4. With it's combination of using key files and different ciphers (at least via plugins), it feels solid and secure. Not that LastPass security is not good enough. It should also be mentioned that LastPass has two-factor authentication. 

Because KeyPass doesn't have a browser extension (at least not out of the box), I use [[https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/][xdotool]] to auto-type passwords into websites' text fields. The workflow: I click the user field on a website, Alt+Tab back to KeyPass, hit the auto-type shortcut, and watch KeyPass putting in my credentials as if I'm typing them from memory. Because I can customize the auto-input macro (KeyPass2 and up), eventually this makes it even more reliable than LastPass' auto-fill feature, which sometimes doesn't work well with fancy animated menus. 

LastPass is another tool I didn't think about replacing when I transitioned into Linux, and for a long time, I kept using it in Linux as well. When I switched away from Chrome and stopped being logged into Google all the time, Chrome's extensions stayed behind. Like many other products (Gmail, Google Docs, Dropbox...) I'm slowly but surely finding good open source options which are often better. 

# remains from daft below: 


# It's the techie's classic story: non-techie parents. My mother is between an iPad mini 2 that reached its end of life, an older iPhone 5, and Windows 7 laptop, and now, a brand new Asus flip Chromebook. 

# The Chromebook was my idea of helping her bridging the gap of using touch screen and having a new fast hardware on the cheaper end. I'm a strong advocate of these devices, which allow people to access good hardware on the cheap, while keeping things secure and organized. This is not a post about how good Chromebooks are, but if you still believe Chromebooks are plastic toys that can't function without internet connection, you should probably get updated.

At work, we are a small team serving a very large gorup of clients. Because of that, automation is very importnat. It is impossible to get to each client directly, and we constantly have our plates full with other projects, walk-ins and general maintanance. 

One project that was recently brought up was detecting and replacing old company-owned Macs that are out of warranty and cannot be upgraded to Apple's newest macOS, which at the time of this writing is [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828][macOS Mojavi (10.14)]]. the idea is to locate these machines and retire them. To do such projects, we use system managment tool, KACE. KACE used to belong to Dell, and is still mostly used for Windows machines (it is most usefuls on Dells, obviously) but in this line of work it's many times using the tools you already have. 

#+hugo: more

**** Identifying macOS 10.14 minimum requirements

Here's Apple's official [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201475][compatible model list]], which contains models by their release date in a buyer-friendly format, such as "MacBook Air introduced in mid 2012 or later." The problem is that this imibgious description doesn't work with  systme management tools, which use the specific  model identifiers (as it should). Given the popularity of Macs, however, it's not hard to find a list of the model identifiers matched with Apple's official list. Here's EveryMac.com's [[https://everymac.com/mac-answers/macos-mojave-faq/macos-mojave-1014-compatible-macs-system-requirements.html][compatible model identifer list]].

Using the above list, we can use this [[https://everymac.com/systems/by_capability/mac-specs-by-machine-model-machine-id.html][full list]] from the same site to fine the first model identifier that will /not/ work for macOS10.14. This model would be the newest model on our "non-compatible list". We need to find each model of the different major Mac families. 

**** Loading it into KACE:  

KACE lists model identifiers under "System Model". It the case here, we are looking at a MacBook Pro 14,2 (which is mid 2017, according to the list above). This is the key we will use to create our filter:

[[file:/mnt/hgfs/Space/hallway/finding-non-macos14-compatible-macs2.png]]


One of KACE's killer features is its smart lables, which allows us to build very detailed filters to profile hardware. Smart labels comb through the entire inventory and capture devices that fit our desired filter. There is a basic wizard built into KACE which allows us to create basic labels, but if we need to dive in deeper we need to use Regex or straight up SQL. 

To create the smart label, I used [[https://www.itninja.com/blog/view/using-regex-in-smart-labels-to-find-lower-versioned-software-w-java-example][this helpful article]]. I suspect KACE's Regex is nothing special, but this was my first time trying to get my hands dirty with it. It was fun! Here's what it looks like: 

[[file:/mnt/hgfs/Space/hallway/finding-non-macos14-compatible-macs1.png]]

As we can see, the filter uses conditions for eahc one of the six family models. Let's take a look at =^(MacBookAir[1-4],)= as an example, keep in mind how the System Model (above) looks like. 

1. Our complete Regex statement needs to be included inside a parenthesis
2. Going back, we use =^= as a starting point. It declares that this is the start of the string, and nothing should come before it.
3. We spell out =MacBookAir= because that's just the text string of the model.
4. Next, square brackets call a range of numbers; in this case, 1 through 4. This goes back to the minimum requirement mentioned previously. Using our lists above, we know that the lowest compatible MacBook Air model for 10.14 is MacBook Air 5,1. This means MacBook Air 4,2 is the first /non-compatible/ Mac we need to capture. This is why any Model Identifiers that include 4,2 and below (4,1 3,2 3,1 etc.)
5. the comman after the number range is just a text string, as we have it in the System Model field in KACE.

**** Creating the report
KACE has the ability to create an automatic report for machiens that answer specific creteria. The reports also come with a built in filter and a wizard, even though not as customizable as the one in smart labels. 

It's generally a good idea to create a report that is based on a smart label because the smart label can be applied to other actions in KACE. For example, if we'd like to later send an alert to the users of these old Macs, telling them to come to IT with their Macs for inspection. Smart Labels also work immidetly with KACE's databse, where reports are built only from new results, meaning we need to wait for Macs to connect and update on KACE before we see results. If someone has a work Mac they generally keep at home and don't connect to our network, we will wait a long time before we know about it. 

in KACE reporting tools, there's an option to base the report directly on a Smart Label, which is what we'll do here. I won't cover the report in this post, but it's important to mention that while the smart label is good to /capture/ the information, the report is much better at /presenting/ it. Use the report to specifiy things like the user's full name, last login to KACE, IP address, etc. The report can also be created as a CSV or HTML file among others, and can be emailed.

It’s been a while since I blogged about my Org activities. Overall, not a lot has changed from my latest setup. Setting up a new site on GitHub with Hugo kept me fairly busy, away from hacking away at Emacs.

[[file:static/OrgUpdate_1.png]]

**** Lighter Agenda: No Sub-Tasks

So, looking at my agenda sometimes less is more. I don’t rush to include every single detail in my agenda anymore, especially at work, becuase it’s redundant. We have a ticketing system that we /have/ to use, and the details are constantly updated by different team members. Because of that, updating technical details for myself again under each heading is not that appealing.

But I do still include notes. Just differently. I start notes with an inactive timestamp and describe where I left off. In other words, exactly what the subtask used to do. So I don’t bother with many sub-tasks anymore. The benefit of one heading is better visual organization. I get a nice Logbook which includes all the time I spent on the project, my notes are more streamlined and easy to find. It also clears the agenda from the clutter of subtasks that sometimes don’t make sense to me anymore because I forgot the big picture already. I also grew more comfortable with changing the header wordings of the task to better reflect what is the big picture I just mentioned. Since I keep short notes of where I left off with the most recent one at the top, it’s easy to see what’s going on.

[[file:static/OrgUpdate_2.png]]

Sometimes I would even copy-paste from the ticket straight into Org just to remind myself what was done; other times I include references to other people and cases; yet other times, if I have to vent about something, there’s a link to my journal (more on that later).

A fun sidenote: Orgzly, my companion Andoird App, [[http://www.orgzly.com/changelog][now has the ability]] to start with Org headings collapsed. This means that when I’m on the go, I can open specifically the task on hand and view my notes which I often update just before I get up to do something.

A little test here. And here.

**** Keeping Track Of Time Without Going Nuts

The Logbook contains estimated times. I almost never get to close a clock on a task once I started, because I almost never get the chance to keep working on one thing before I am called away, or have to do a prerequisite. Other times, I simply forget to start the clock. I estimate how much time I worked on something when I’m back at my desk. Now, since I don’t bother with sub-tasks and separate clocking times for these, it means I need to expend my agenda to view my logs (l in agenda view). This allows me to see the time I spent working on a certain task, even though it is marked as done later, sometimes even days (or weeks) later. This way I know when the whole task was finished, and I can see when (and for how long) I was working on it.

All of that said, most of my tasks don't get logged with a clock. That’s because many of them are simple tasks or just interruptions when I am asked a question or something similar. I should overall though get in the habit of logging tasks in retro-respect to see where my time went.

Another area I stopped worrying as much about are which org files in my archive my headers go to when I refile. This was a mouthful so let me explain.

My system is based on a weekly review. Every week has its own .org file. In the past, filenames used to specify a date range like =08102018_15102018.org=, for example. This caused me complications because I seldom had the chance to summarize and finish my week Sunday and start a clean slate Monday. Many times I wanted to conclude an .org file on a Friday after work or didn’t get the chance to do so until Monday or even Tuesday. Besides, this whole week range thing is redundant because you can always list files by dates anyway (to see when it was last modified).

On the other hand, since I started using my journal again, which is based on weeks rather than months, it made more sense to name the files after the number of the weeks. For instance, this week is w41.org, last week was w40.org, etc. My journal tells me what week I’m on if I ever need to reflect, the file name is very clear and obvious and there’s no room for confusion. My weekly summaries will always be based on their respective =<number>.org=, even if I summarize a month later.

In the past, I refiled events and tasks depending on what week they were to take place. If I was planning a vacation four weeks in advance, for example, I would open a new file for that week and place the event there. This lead to all kinds of problems when I worked on projects that stretched over more than just a weekly period. Let’s say I take a vacation from Friday to Monday of next week. Now what, which file do I choose? At the time, I opted for the completion date. But, this too wasn’t simple. Because certain projects (especially at work) could last even months, or re-surface from the past. That would mean I would have to move them to the appropriate week and think about what “done” really means. One day thinking about it out loud, I just started laughing at myself: “dude,” I said, as I like to refer anyone for some reason, “what are you doing? Org takes care of all of that for you automatically! That’s what’s the Agenda is for!” Who cares if I placed a project in week 20 or week 30, I don’t ever search it that way or know where it comes from anyway, I just see it on the agenda or search for it with the agenda anyway =(C-a s)=. That’s what it’s for. So I stopped caring about that, and events now naturally fall into the week I created them.

**** The Journal Revisited

I don’t use the journal as much as I used to when I had it earlier this year. I find that I use it capture experiences and emotions more than technical notes. For the later, I now have an org file called “wiki” which I keep organized as it grows further. The journal is good to keep moods and mental “patterns” I can look into on my weekly review. For this, I also use tags. This is a good exercise that allows me to recognize mental “traps” I get into more often than not.

The journal works nicely with my weekly reviews, which are essentially weekly videos I make reading back from my agenda and journal. With time, these became more of a personal “summary of summaries” where I highlight my week tasks and review, usually for a 10-minute segment or so. I keep these in a well-compressed mp4 format on an SD card ([[https://ffmpeg.org/][FFMPEG]] is awesome for that) and I can easily use one SSD for an entire year and still have additional room. I am now starting to name the videos based on the same weekly theme that I use for my weekly agenda files and journal.

Over time, my videos definitely got smaller. This is because I got used to Org in different areas of recording my thoughts. I [[https://jarss.github.io/TAONAW/blog/org-update/][discussed these]] couple of times before: tasks, task notes, and journal.

#+hugo: more

My tasks do rarely contain sub-tasks anymore. This is odd because sub-tasking was one of the reasons that got me into Org-mode initially. Over time I found that I rather leave notes to myself about where I left off and what needs to be done instead of using actual tasks.

Task notes are usually brief (one paragraph with 3 to 5 lines) and are always timestamped with most recent on top. This quickly lets me know where I stopped a task and why. Interestingly, I use it also to indicate general mundane errands, like grocery shopping. In such cases, I can also include a checklist. 

The journal is a different story. This is where I let myself spill the beans. I took a long break from using a journal because I felt there's so much recording done on a keyboard, and I wanted a quicker way to record my thoughts.

But recording my thoughts was inconvenient. I had to take a break from my workflow, record a video, name it, compress it, and save it. It required that I'll find a quiet corner - nearly impossible to do during my day - to record for a few minutes. So out of necessity, I started to include more text in my task notes. Eventually, I felt they become too long, too personal, and just too heavy. I needed a separation and going back to my journal felt natural. 

I find that typing is just slow enough to make me process what I'm thinking. I can edit what I'm trying to say, which means I can rethink of a better way of describing it. To prevent myself from going on and on, I journal on specific events only, never an entire day. My capture template takes the link of my event and makes it the title, and then continue to discuss only that event. 

Yesterday, I noticed something interesting: with time, my rambling on videos was reduced from going on an on for an hour plus or so (and multiple videos) to shorter segments. Here's a visual: 

[[file:static/videojournalevolved_1.png]]

/Above: over time, my clips become shorter/ 

Finally, last weekend, I reached the conclusion that my written journal is just /better/ at keeping track of my experiences. Since I re-created the way I save my achieve files now, it also means the links from the journal org file to the org and the events is never broken: I just have to make sure to refile an event from my "oh snap" thought-dump org into the current week org file, and I'm good. 

I still record a short "weekly summary" on weekends, and now I find I'm actually looking forward to it. These are now 10-20 minutes long videos in which I briefly go through my agenda and logged events and explain what happened while my memories of this week are still fresh. I then give the week a "theme". 

This works as a way for me to remember what happened far in the future if I want to reflect on my experiences but not looking for something specific, or not sure what it is. It's also a good way to reflect on the major events of the week after I had a weekend to slow down and process. It works.

    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Emacs Windows Managment
    :END:

In his 5th Emacs podcast, [[https://emacscast.org/episode_5/][Rakhim]] discusses the difficulties of windows management in Emacs. I agree with him. Emacs' Windows are a pain. It was probably one of the longest pet peeves I had with the program, and it wasn't until this podcast that I realized that I'm much better off than I used to be. 

#+hugo: more

I don't use any extension that manages windows (unless you consider Ivy's switch buffer, which he uses too. [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is awesome). My method is based on bits and pieces I picked up. Here are a couple of lines from my settings.org, which I use to make Emacs' windows work better for me. 

First, for my ultra-wide screen at home, it helps to enlarge the default frame size. After a few tests, I found this size satisfying: 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(setq default-frame-alist '((width . 90) (height . 50) (menu-bar-lines . 6)))
#+END_SRC

Then, we need to turn on the mouse vertical mouse divider. This will allow us to use the mouse to drag and adjust windows in our frame vertically as well. I actually don't use this as much anymore (the reason is coming up) but this is a basic feature that should be on by default, in my opinion: 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(window-divider-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

Another basic feature, which I now use everywhere, is the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Visual-Line-Mode.html][visual line mode]]. If you write more than you code on Emacs (which is true in my case) this mode just makes sense. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-visual-line-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

Those are all good and nice, but here's the biggest tip which I stumbled upon a few months back, from [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_effective_windows_management.html][Ergoemacs]]: just don't use windows. Use frames. Seriously, it's that simple. There are probably many Emacs experts out there with their windows functions and extensions and what not, but let's not reinvent the wheel here. If there's one thing a GUI is good for is to manage windows (or frames in Emacs). They are very easy to move with the mouse, they snap to each other, easy to resize. Besides, Emacs itself splits the frames to Windows often enough. I find that I use C-0 and C-1 very often to get rid of windows I don't need, and I can have them back quickly by switching back to the buffer with Ivy.

One of the things that used to drive my bananas when I started using Org was how the agenda and its habit to kill my windows setup. One of the most helpful lines in my settings.org is the following: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-window-setup (quote other-frame))
#+END_SRC

This saved me from going insane. Since I start up my agenda every time I start up my Emacs, this shortcut also effectively creates the other frame for me to work with until I exit Emacs. From there, I can just use the Agenda frame itself to switch to another buffer if I want to. Agenda is also the only place where I do use windows often - when I tab into one of my headers there. I tab into a task, view it, make changes if I want, save, and C-0 to return to full agenda view. It's so fast it's just my muscle memory now.

I was happy to reply and figured it would be intesting to dig into my capture templates. I started writing this post explaining all of my templates, but then realized I'm starting to edit out details because the post is getting too long. So instead, I'm going to explain each template at a time. Hopefully you find this interesting!  

#+hugo: more

First, Here's the code for the capture templates I'm going to cover:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
        ("i" "INC" entry (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Incidents")
        "** TODO %? \n  %^{Ticket}p %^{PIN}p %^{Computer}p %^{Location}p \n")
        ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/Documents/Personal/journal.org")
        "**** %U%?%a \n" :tree-type week)
        ("t" "ToDo" entry (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Tasks")
        "** TODO %? \n SCHEDULED: %^T \n")
        ("e" "Event" entry (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Event")
        "** %? \n %^T \n")
#+END_SRC

Going into details below, I broke the code down so it makes sense to people starting out with Org-mode in hope this would help new-commers like I was not too long ago. If these steps do not sound right (especially for those of you who know Emacs lisp better than me, which is probably 99% of you...) please let me know so I can correct and learn. Thanks! 

Ok, here we go.  

**** Part 1 - The INC Template 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
("i" "INC" entry 
  (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Incidents")

"** TODO %? \n  
  %^{Ticket}p %^{PIN}p %^{Computer}p %^{Location}p \n
")
#+END_SRC

1. For key-press "i" initiate "INC" template as follows: 
2. Create a headline "Incidents" in file  =~/Documents/Archive/#OhSnap!.org=...
3. ...As a second level header. Create a TODO keyword, space, place cursor here, new line.
6. Create Property "Ticket" and ask for input.
7. Create Property "PIN" and ask for input
8. Create Property "Computer" and ask for input
9. Create Property "Location" and ask for input
10. Space, New line
11. Finish


I use the above template for ticket creation at work. The file "OhSnap.org" is my "dumping grounds" for everything before I sort it out- usually in front of a desktop. This is useful to me because many times I'm running around using my phone with [[http://www.orgzly.com][Orgzly]], a very minimal version of Org-mode. I click the add note widget, speak or write out my note in a few words, and save. Later I add details. (By the way, going on a tangent here: you can use Google Assistant on your phone with Orgzly like any other note taking app: "OK Google, make note: buy eggs today" - and bam, you have a quick header in your org file.)

The properties help me keep my work-related issues organized. I have the ticket number for the issue, which is also the fastest way to find it in our ticketing system. Then I have the person's ID, to quickly identify the person's name and email from the directory if I need to. The computer property is the hostname, so I can remote in or know where it is. Location is helpful because we span over different buildings and even parts of the city. In turn, this also makes Column view beneficial if I want to quickly see all the tickets formatted in a nice table. I don't use it often, but it's there.  

I don't always have all the properties filled in (though I do try to at least have a ticket and a person's name entered), but I do use this template for anything work related. This is because I have a "work" category property inside the Incident tree, which quickly shows me my work related things on my agenda. This means I can also quickly filter into just work-related stuff if I need to, say, when I show something to my co-workers. 

Let me expand on that last at the risk of going into a somewhat unrelated tangent: one of the huge things about Org-mode efficiency in my case is the ability to mix work and personal items in the same place. I have different apps, difference accounts, and different devices, and Org-mode is the first place where I'm comfortable mixing all of them into one agenda because I still have individual org files. This /very/ helpful to keep me organized. 

This concludes part 1. As you can see I went into other areas that are not directly related to the template itself. Let me know what you think, and if you want me to expand further! Thanks for reading.

I was happy to see part one of this series generated interest on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/agxe8n/my_orgmode_templates_part_one_any_interest_in_more/][Reddit]]. One of the things I love about Org-mode (and Emacs) is this passion among its user and the thirst to learn more from each other. I believe one of the major reasons for that is Org-mode's complexity: there are so many options, it /has/ to be personalized by its users' needs. Org-mode is esaily the most personal tool I've used in a while. Every time I read something Org-mode related somewhere else it's as if I'm invited over for a discussion over a cup of coffee. 

#+hugo: more

Speaking of personal, today I'm going to discuss my Journal capture template. I hope you enjoy, and as always, comments are welcome on Reddit (follow me using the links above) at least until I integrate a commenting system on this site.

**** Part 2 - The Journal template

First, here's the code: 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
("j" "Journal" entry 
  (file+datetree "~/Documents/Personal/journal.org")
  
  "**** %U%?%a \n" :tree-type week)
#+end_src

1. For key-press "j" initiate "Journal" template, which as follows:
2. Go to =~/Documents/Personal/journal.org= and create a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html#DOCF82][dateree]] entry there
3. Create a sub header (level 4) under the day header, under the week header, under the year header (a function of datetree, see link above). 
4. Enter an inactive timestamp, place cursor right after it, place a link to file you were just in.
5. New line
6. Make this a /weekly/ datetree (the default is a monthly datetree)
7. Finish

I prefer a weekly format in my journal over a monthly format. In fact, the week is a "productivity unit" which always made sense to me, and this mindset integrates beautifully into Org-mode. In my archive folder, which you saw in part 1, each week has its own =.org= file (from 1 to 50 something). I don't really need this to make Org-mode work, but there's something assuring in viewing the folder and seeing all the week files.

The reason the timestamp and the link are condensed together (no space) is because I delete most of the timestamp and just leave the hour. This way the cursor is where I need to start erasing the timestamp from. I haven't found a way yet to create an hourly timestamp only and I don't want to forget to put in the hour, so this is the best solution for now. Why is the hour important? First, personal preference from the past, where I would write the time and the location for each entry. Second, this helps me see a couple of entries in the journal that are about the same event (the title is just the name of the event on my agenda) so that if a certain event is developing and I've journaled about it a couple of times, I can easily see the hour of each entry as a separator. 

Finally, I use a link to connect me back to =w[##].org= file (week number of the year, as I mentioned above) from which I created the journal entry. In my weekly org files, the incidents or events themselves contain very little details, usually only what is my next action (next thing to do) and a logbook drawer containing the times I worked on a task if I keep track. If I want to discuss something, I create a journal entry for it. I always prefer to leave my thoughts and conclusions in a personal space, separate from the more generic org file which also contains work-related material. The link takes me back to that event or incident, and because the name is the same as the event, I know exactly what I'm referring to. 

[[file:static/Org-capture-template-2.1.png]]

My journal is another feature of Org-mode that fits my workflow effortlessly. The notion that I keep entries around events rather than just a daily or a semi-daily habit works well and behooves me to write my thoughts down often. At the same time, the journal file is kept in a personal folder that is not synced to my work VM. I use TRAMP inside my work VM's capture template, so when I want to capture something in my journal from work, I'm prompted to log into my file server with a password, without saving anything at work. 

This privacy barrier may sound cumbersome, but once working, I almost never have to tweak with it. This kind of privacy and separation of my personal files from the cloud help me sleep better at night.

I took a long unplanned break from writing about my Templates because of the [[https://joshrollinswrites.com/blogging/css-updates-1/][CSS changes]] I worked on and the complications with Magit. I'm happy to say these are now behind me, and that I gained another grain of confidence using Magit and knowing git, but this is a post for yet another time. 

Since the last two templates are rather short, I'm putting them both here together. Here we go: 

#+hugo: more

**** Part 3 - The Tasks Template

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ("t" "ToDo" entry 
   (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Tasks")

     "** TODO %? \n SCHEDULED: %^T \n"
 )
#+end_src

1. For key-press "t" initiate "ToDo" template, which is  as follows:
2. Go to =~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org= and create a headline "tasks" there.
3. Create a second level header, space, add a TODO keyword, space, Place cursor here. New line.
4. Add the text "=SCHEDULED:=", space, and ask for a complete timestamp (date and time). 
5. New line
6. Finish


To create a regular "todo" item, I want to have it scheduled right away so it's on my agenda. The word =SCHEDULED:= is what initiates the scheduling in Org-mode. On my agenda, I clearly see scheduled tasks, and I try to schedule everything I want to do. Scheduling a task then is my actual "To Do" trigger, not the TODO keyword. 

Of course, things often get shifted around. I constantly reschedule things at work. The benefit of scheduling tasks this way is that tasks I haven't done are highlighted for the next day, so I know to revisit it.  That's all there is to this template, it's rather simple. 

**** Part 4 - The Event Template

The Event template is probably the first one I created. It changed around quite a bit. This is my go-to personal stuff template which works hand in hand with my journal. Here it is: 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ("e" "Event" entry 
   (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Event")
        "** %? \n %^T \n"
 )
#+end_src

1. For key-press "e" initiate "event" template as follows:
2. Create a headline "Event" in file ="~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org"=...
3. ...As a second level header. Place cursor here. New line.
4. Prompt for a complete active timestamp. New line.
5. Finish

Even simpler than the previous template, this one asks for a complete timestamp (date and time) without a keyword. The active timestamp alone means that this event will show on my agenda, but without the scheduling, it's not highlighted as a task (in my theme, tasks are in green and events are in gray). I use these "concrete" events for meeting with other people, or something that is happening with other people that are important to me.
Events usually have an ending time, even if it's speculative. I go back in later to adjust the timeframe. 

I usually follow the event title with a @ sign and link to the location on Google maps if I can. This creates a nice way for me to reflect back later in my journal, which links to these events. For example, an event could be "=<2019-01-13 Sun 19:00-21:00> dinner with Marcy @ The Green Inn=" and The Green Inn would be a link to the location. A quick =C-c o= and the browser opens to the right location, and I can look up directions. The location links also work from Orgzly on my phone, though I'm looking into integrating this whole thing with Google Calendar, which should work better. 

After an event took place, I place the cursor on it in my agenda and initiate the journal capture template, as I explained above. Something I started doing lately is to store the link of the journal entry while there =(C-c C-l)=, and then enter a [J] at the end of the title of the event on the agenda, linking to the journal entry. If this works well, I will look into creating a macro or a function to create this journal link automatically. Shouldn't be too hard.

If you've bseen following me online for the last month or so (especially on reddit) you'd know I've been engaged in shifting away from WordPress and into the world [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]. 

#+hugo: more 

I'd imagine the people of in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/][r/emacs]] would raise an eyebrow at the term "world of Hugo." After all, Hugo is a relatively simple program, not a deep rabbit-hole like Emacs. Yet, it's Hugo that got me overwhelemed, not so much Emacs. What? Really? 

 You see, it has to do with background and expectations. As a non-programmer (as in, someone who never wrote anything a bit more complicated then a few lines of shell script) Emacs was a mountain. Standing at the bottom, I gazed at the cloud shrowing its peek and told myself "well, you gotta take a first step somewhere..." so I did. For me, that was Org-mode. As a matter of fact, at the time, I didn't even know much about Emacs and how deep it can get. All I knew was that Org was cool, and I'm interested in learning more.

 After a couple of months, I got a bit more comfortable with Emacs and my level of doing things with it. I am still miles away from the top, and I'm fine with that. I got Emacs to do most of what I want it to do for me at this point, which is writing these posts, my journal entries, and of course my agenda and tasks both at work and at home. 

 Hugo, on the other hand, was meant to replace WordPress. As a person who used WordPress on and off a couple of years, I expected more or less the same thing. You know, going to my webiste online somewhere, log in with a username and password, navigate the GUI and post stuff, add plugins... As such, I didn't care for a change that much. WordPress was working more or less OK, so why change to something similar and learn things all over again? 

 I get frequent alerts that my website is down from my webhost, but I got used to shrug these off. I got it as a cheap deal, and for about $6 a month or so hosting, what do you expect? People in the Emacs reddit mentioned they see more spam from my site's URL instead of my posts, but again, with 1 person complaining out of 10 or so, it wasn't a big deal. After all, SSL and https is for professional website that can afford it, and I am just an amatuer-ish blogger. Perhaps the biggest hurdle was Github: I knew people who use Hugo usually use Github to publish their blog, but they were all programmers. Me, I didn't know anything about Github or git. That was for coders, people who write scripts for a living. This is not me. I am not a porgrammer. 

 To be honest, I'm not sure what changed that perspective. Perhaps it was a random tutorial I saw about Git which made me realize it's not /that/ crazy complicated. Perhaps it was the fact that someone advised me not to link to my website again if I don't have https. Maybe it was just my inner geek, itching for a change, and WordPress was getting too familiar and too boring. Whatever it was, I took the bait, and I started doing all of it at once. 

 First I watched some Lynda videos about git and read a few posts. Then, I learned more about Hugo. After that, it was [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]]'s turn (because I gotta write my posts from inside Emacs), and then it was [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] (because I gotta use git from inside Emacs). I think I went through everything in a matter of about a month. I learned too much too fast. But that's how I roll. I don't know why I do that to myself, and I'm not sure how it makes sense to go from "git is for coders" to "ALL THE THINGS," but I do anyway. 

 Obviously, this attitude has terrible consequences. You learn everything on a very shallow level, which means the first tiny bump in the road sends you launching out of control. You get frustrated and you try again, just to hit another bump. Turns out, if I /learn everything/ I also expect to /know everything/ out of myself, which is of course nonsense. But not everything is futile. Knowing the big picture in advance is not a bad idea. Learning a couple of things at once make you realize how they work together, and helps you develop a mindset that is more skilled at solving specific problems. Later, when you go look at the official documents, certain things already make sense to you even though you haven't seen them before. 

 Be it as it may, it's not easy. I wouldn't recommend this method to anyone. it's doing damage control instead of learning. However, manuals never made sese to me. In the rare occessions where I do have the patience to read through the introduction, I'd forget what I wanted to do (or how to do it) by the time I get the real stuff. Besides, manuals are usually written by the people who made the program; as such, they are written from the inside, for insiders. Certain terms and syntax make aboslutely no sense to newcomers, who find that they struggle with basic terms that the veterans spit out as if they were born into it. Indeed, if there's one thing that I kept running into when learning Emacs is /not/ to bother with its documentation. As helpful as it is, and as much as everyone loves to say all the help you ever want is C-h v (or a or whatever) away, it was not true for me. It is much, much easier to Google something up and find a blog post (or a YouTube video) that explains it to you in plain English.

Now I'm much further ahead than where I was when I started my Hugo ordeal. I have sucessfully launched a couple of testing websites on and off Github. I have whined, complained, and whined again to anyone who would listen.


So, here we are with Hugo. I use git, and well, the site is on Github. This post was written with ox-hugo. I used Magit, but because there are so many issues I'm running into, I decided to make a decision not to use it for at least another month. It's very hard to hold myself back, for sure. On one hand, since I've done WordPress for so long, I'm aching to go back to my old website where I don't have problems learning how to create a new static page (that doesn't show on the front page of this blog), or how exactly images work with these posts, or how can I automate the long process of saving a post and updating my Hugo website compared to the simple "click to publish"  in WordPress. I'm sure some of you are aching to tell me just how to do some of these things. Don't worry, I'll get back to you.  

Oh, and speaking of helpful people: a big thank you to [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi][Kaushal Modi]], who kept answering my endless questions, who was there through my frustration, anywhere I went. This guy is passionate and compassionate about what he does.

PayPal informed me that the host of my WordPress blog is charging me for another $80 or so for the next year. The very next day, tumblr [[https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231885248-Sensitive-content][decided to shoot itself in the head]] (rather than the leg, if you ask me). It was good to be reminded to not trust cloud services for creative content - like my blog. 

 #+hugo: more

**** The Issues With my Host

My current host sucks. My WordPress blog continuously goes offline, so much so that I had to mute the alerts I got because they overwhelmed my inbox. My connection issues never got resolved. 

Another major issue with that website was the lack of https (this is not my host fault, actually, it's just yet another thing you need to buy) and the constant spam I got on the website. People would go to my link and find a totally different website trying to sell them something. That issue was not resolved either. 

There were other technical issues, from WordPress not functioning right due to database corruptions (the host had an automatic set up process), to my domain not being resolved correctly. In the past, such issues would die out in the first month or two when I switch to a new host -- but not this time. This time, as soon as I got the notification of renewal from PayPal, I immediately asked for cancellation. 

**** More Work to be Done

There's a lot more work to do on this website. I am still not happy with it, and I believe my WordPress blog overall looked better still. But it is up to me to make this place better with my own set of growing skills. CSS, ox-Hugo, Go, and of course, the quality (and quantity) what I write matter. 

I'm also not entirely happy with the blog hosted on GitHub, which is now owned by Microsoft. It's no difference than Tumblr being bought out by Yahoo. I need to move to an actual host with a more liberal point of view about sexual content. Unfortunately, in this world of ours, this means I'm looking for a host that is OK with Pornography. They have to include everything in one blanket statement so it's easy to sort out in courts, in case someone gets offended. But I'm not going to go down that hole right now, there's a whole lot of it, more than enough, on the internet right now with people freaking out about Tumblr. 

So what's the solution...? 

I believe AWS (Amazon hosting service) might be it for now. I find it hard to believe they'd bother chasing me if I mention a sexual encounter or show a picture of a breast. Still, even AWS is not a safe haven. Hmmm.

Even though it doesn't show on this blog (yet), I've been blogging since I got into college, more than a decade ago. Blogging is an activity that combines a couple of passions for me: writing, technology. and visual creativity. My process hasn't changed much over the years, and the tools I taught myself to use help me maintaining my routine. This is a quick explanation of its main components. 

#+hugo:more

**** Using the Journal

I usually create an event on my agenda and then write a journal entry about that specific event. This could mean several entries a day for different events, or on the other hand, only a few entries a month. This event-to-journal approach is helpful because it prevents me from writing too much at once and it keeps me focused. 

Pictures are another thing. I've created a script that automatically resizes and labels photos from my phone to streamline the process. Pictures are useful on two levels: first, it's a personal visual to decorate what I'm writing and makes it more memorable; second, the [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=undo+org-capture-kill&t=lm&ia=web][geolocation]] in the photo and the name of the file serves as a way for me to know where I've been specifically and at what time, very useful for a quick reality "bookmark" so I can refer to it later when I write. For example, I will take a picture of pies in a pie shop, and later I will title the post "2018-12-24, 16:04 @ Big Pie Shoppe," and the place name would be a link to Google Maps showing me that location.  

Because the journal contains personal things which are usually not immediately shareable or worth blogging about, I have a basic rule of thumb: I blog about experiences that happened at least a month ago. This allows some emotional distance from something I wrote about too impulsively in my journal and might want to reconsider. It also allows me to think of the event in question more like a story as I reflect on it. which makes the post more interesting to read. The idea is that if I have a good story to share, it can wait a month or even more and still be good.

**** Making an Outline

For me, making a basic outline is crucial. The outline is also a good tool to keep the post in a digestible length, something in the neighborhood of 500-700 words. An Outline is nothing more than a bunch of bullet points which I expand on as I write. I do write longer posts, but these are usually more of the technical, instruction-like texts. 

Another good thing about outlining is that it allows me to finish a post before I run out of "creative juice." I write for about 40 minutes (give or take), and when I feel I'm done, it's easy to get up and do something else. I return later to my draft to shape it into something worth reading, look for typos and grammar issues, and get it ready for posting.

[[file:static/drafting_a_post.png]] 

**** My Tools: Hugo and Org-mode

I started looking into [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] about three months ago as a replacement for WordPress. For non-programmers and people who are new to Git and GitHub (like I was), Hugo is not easy to pick up. I can't recommend Hugo to folks who just want to start writing; it's just too damn complicated. For me, as a techie and as a person on the lookout for a low-cost, reliable and secure solution, Hugo is excellent to learn and use. My website hosting is completely free, and the writing is integrated seamlessly into my journal, my calendar, and my tasks. It works well, but [[https://joshrollinswrites.com/blogging/hugo-beginnings/][it was /not/ easy to get there]].

Org-mode is a huge topic in itself which I've spent hours writing about in other places. Speaking from a blogging perspective, I use a "bridging" piece called [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][Ox-hugo]] which translates what I write in Org-mode to Hugo. If you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, here's a way to think of it: Hugo is the publishing platform (think of it as WordPress), and Org-mode is the writing tool (think of it as - shiver - Word or Google Docs). Ox-hugo is what copy-pastes from Word/Google Docs to WordPress, complete with links, formatting, headers, etc. 

These tools keep my writing easy and natural. What I write on my blog looks the same as what I write in my journal which looks the same as what's on my agenda. To me, that's one of the things that allows me to write much more frequently than ever before in a distraction-free environment. The complete opposite of MS Word, if you ask me.

About some CSS Updates... and why I haven't posted in the last two weeks or so. (Changes are now complete!) 

#+hugo: more

Last week I started making some changes for my current Hugo theme, [[https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/][Hyde]]. This was after I tried out the [[https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/][Hermit]] theme and found out the hard way that my site is already "committed" to Hyde. Some of my customizations did not work well in Hermit and required more tweaking, while other parts of the theme didn't look as good to me as they did on first impression. 
 

So instead of changing a theme I started tweaking my current one and got myself lost between the branches of Git. Going in, I knew the changes I'm working on need more time than I could commit to in one sitting. Creating another branch seemed to be the way to go. Things got out of hand when I realized I never started a new branch. I was working on my master branch, which was now out of sync with the one on GitHub. 

If you find the above confusing -- that's fine. The problem was that I was in the same boat as you are now, scratching my head and going "huh?" And the more I struggled, the bigger mess I've made. 

Thankfully, folks like [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi][Kaushalmodi]] exist. I don't know where I would be without his help. Not on a Hugo site using Git, that's for sure. I've learned a couple of things from him and the experience this time: 

[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] can be very helpful to get back on track. That's because it gives you sort of a road map to your project. You cay see the branches and then /go up and down the list using the arrow keys to choose the right location/. For the first time, I saw the benefit of doing that because of the mess I was in. 

a whole menu of options is a question mark away, and everything has a hotkey. Magit was something I stayed away from in the past because I'm still scared of Git. After my last experience tough, I should keep using Magit for my work on this site. Magit is more effective and visual, and to me, the later is crucial. 

I will babble some more about my tweaks and CSS as I work on things. I will keep updates in this category ([[https://joshrollinswrites.com/blogging/][Blogging]]) so you can follow up, or ignore them. 

**** Changes now merged (2019-02-06) 

I completed some initial changes to the CSS and merged with back with my main site version. 

Those of you who understand git won't think much of it: all I did was marge a branch. Those of you who don't understand git won't think of it at all. 

To me however, this is quite a big deal. I have successfully finished my first merge, in Magit none-the-less, after implementing changes on another branch. 

**** Changes implemented

Most of the complaints I got about my current layout is the width of the sidebar to the left. It takes a lot of space, and for people who like to work with small screens, this was very annoying. The other issues I found was that this theme has three layout versions (we can call them extra wide, wide, and narrow). They were also indicated in ems and rems in the CSS, which I didn't like. 

When it comes to screen width, I prefer to use pixels. So the site now has two versions: more than 800px and less than 800px. I will tweak with these some more (I think 600 as a max is better). The sidebar was tweaked to be narrower, as well as the site's title font. 

Next, I think I will turn my attention to the navigation links themselves (under Topics) and make them more obvious with pure CSS; I have no intention of uploading fancy images. I also want to break the empty white at the right of the content in a way that doesn't make it all look so empty. We will see what happens there. 

If anything looks off to you, please let me know in the comments! Thank you.

You don't need to look hard to find the holes in this Emperor's clothes. Apple has been heading downhill for a couple of years, but it's only recently that the public at large started to take notice.  

#+hugo: more

Two good articles last week, one by [[https://www.wired.com/story/silver-lining-apples-very-bad-iphone-news/][Brian Barett]] in Wired and the other by [[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/technology/apple-iphone-replacement-mom.html][Kevin Roose]] in the NYT. Both explain the issue behind Apple's disappointing sales are closer to home than what Steve Cook would like us to think: consumers don't rush in to buy expensive new iPhones when their older ones are almost just as capable and work fine. " 'It used to be that for $650, you got all new features, a better screen, everything,” ' says one tech analyst in the Times' article. Now the phone costs at least $100 more (and the cost goes up easily since you need to buy parts and upgrades) for not much new. 

There's more going on than just smarter customers and humdrum technology from Apple, and you don't need to go digging to find the issue. Tim Cook is basically [[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/][saying]] it himself: Apple is a services company now. Tech pundits including famed [[https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning][John Gruber]] agree. 

But While Cook and Gruber believe in the "services first" future for Apple, the public is starting to digest the "hardware is second" present. Apple's hardware is mediocre at best, easily compare able with other leading tech company like Microsoft, Google, and Samsung. And, like these companies, Apple's products are prone to defects that are highlighted by Cook's more apologetic (and, I believe, increasingly frightened) reactions. The era of "You're holding it wrong" is over. 

Apple used to be untouchable in its innovative software /and/ hardware quality. Today, the remains of the glorious past is a hefty price tag.

The best way to explain what am I talking about, is a quick visual. 

# hello Vienmo??

If you haven't heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities:_Skylines][Cities Skylines]] before, the important thing to take from this video is that everything you see is located by the player (in this case, me). You can go as far deep as placing down each individual building and road down to the cracks in the aslphalt and the billboard signs if you want to. Some people [[https://i.redd.it/pta30b5n6lu11.png][go to that extent]] (you can see many amazing pictures like these in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines][game's reddit]]), but such realism requires more attention to details (and PC power) than I have. After all, some of these guys have been spending months, even /years/, into their cities. Yes you read it right, years. 

For me, the game is just the right mixture of visual beauty, attention to details, and peace of mind working on it. I can spend hours at a time into the night building parts of my city, listening to classic music. I emerge from my room after a long day at work smiling, humming to myself. 

Cities Skylines is a good example of why I keep playing video games, and what kind of games I keep getting back to.

#+hugo: more

When it was time to build a base on my second attempt at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnautica][Subnautica]], I picked a location near the [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Blood_Kelp_Zone][Blood Kelp Zone]]. Its cliff walls spread in front of me into the endless blue, and deep down I could see the pale [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Bloodvine][bloodvines]] reaching up toward me like the claws of a forgotten demon. As if by cue, scary dramatic music started playing, and my PDA's AI announced that the zone "matches 7 of the 9 preconditions for stimulating terror in humans." I was thankful the game creators didn't include the two other ones, whatever these may be.  

The reason I chose this location for my home was because of fear. Subnautica is a game about fear, and it was teaching me to face it one step at a time. The first time I played, the game had the element of surprise. I remember my first [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper_Leviathan][reaper]]: it came out of nowhere and grabbed my [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Seamoth][Seamoth]] like a plaything. I  yelped, slammed the Alt+F4 keys, and stomped out of my room white like the hallway wall I was leaning against, mumbling "oh my god" over and over. Now I know better. I know where they are, I can see them in the distance, and... I'm still scared. But I go ahead anyway. The fear is not pushing me away; it's teaching me to be prepared. The only thing that's really scary is fear itself.

Now, the base is furnished complete with a [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Moonpool][Moonpool]] for my Seamoth which I call "Discovery." It is powered by a nuclear reactor I built from fractions retrieved from brave explorations. A single glass corridor connects my living area to a bubble-like observatory room which hovers directly over the dark abyss. There's a chair in the middle of that observatory, so I can sit and read my PDA's contents while staring fear in the face. 

I've found something at the bottom of the abyss. "Something that shouldn't be there." It's a dark, green-hellish looking place with bones of creatures the size of an apartment building. Each day I explore further. Each day I push further and the game never fails to scare me. Winning these small battles against myself bit by bit becomes addictive. I look back at what scared me before and I know I've conquered it. I know that now if one of these monsters chooses to attack my base, I will fight it. The base hanging over the cliff that once terrorized me is now my home, transformed into my new comfort zone. I know every fold in the ground, every floaters-covered rock, every hole to the mushroom cave. You can't be scared of what you know. Subnautica is an excellent teacher of this lesson.

I'm basing my viewing on [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/1520/in-what-order-should-the-star-wars-movies-be-watched][this guide]] from stackexchange with slight modifications:

[[file:static/rewatching-starwars.jpg]]

according to the comments, Rouge One fits after New Hope, and I felt Solo fits after The Empire Strikes Back. 

So here's what I've watched so far, and what I thought: 

# Continue New Hope below

**** New Hope 

There's not much to say, because there's so much to say. This is the movie that started it all, and it does Star Wars justice to start here. The story is mostly concentrated on Luke Skywalker, but also puts into place the essential Star Wars story blocks: the Force, Jedis, the Empire and the Rebelion.


One of the things I love about Star Wars in general is how the Force combines the idea of a religion as I feel it should be. It's a strict practice that requires dedication and development, 

**** Rouge One
Rouge One was a good surprise. I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it felt it was. It seems it just a space filler for a trival story, but it turned out to be more complicated in a good way.

First, it's not just a simple story of good vs evil. This is a movie about making decisions. Just like in real life, many decisions are not pure bad or pure good, but a mix of both. While this is all happening, the movie also tells us more about the Empire and its ambions. 

The one thing in this movie that was a bit over the top for me was that everyone dies. The movie drives the "heros that die for a cause" a bit too far, and death became an empty emphasis making you think when's the next hero's turn is up. 

Rouge one fits best at the second place. It tells an unexpectidly good story, and it does so relatively well without getting trapped in too many character-driven cliche's. It's the story that moves this movie a long, not over-focus on the characters which are not all too important at this point.  
 
**** The Empire Strikes Back

**** Solo
I can sum this movie in one word: "meh". And sometimes the "meh" turned "eck," and "eck" means I usually pause the movie and go do something else because it feels too much like a chore. 

I don't know if it's because I watched The Empire Strikes Back before with all of its 80s cinimatic social norms of the time that made Solo's norms stand out so much, but they did. Of this, L3-37 is a godo example: a robot with a bit attitude, making a giant, unavoidable nod to all rebels today. Perhaps I'm just getting old (it feels more like an excuse the more I say it) but I long ran out of patient for the rebel kinds around me. Watch a sci-fi movie is supposed to be a certain escape for me, but that droid made that impossible. 

Since I'm already here, let's talk about other things that /could/ have been mentioned and weren't, if we're already taking a rebelious stand point. Most notibly, the cliche love story of a boy goes back to save a girl. Wouldn't it be great if Solo went back to meet an adult no BS Qi'ra that just moved on? Maybe she got a ship herself, kicks ass on her own right, and just doesn't have interest to ignight teenage love. 

This movie is too loaded with social cliche's of our time, and I recognize that they are cliche's because I'm surrounded by them all the time, unlike the ones from the older movies.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I still think you should use a password manager. So do the ethical hackers with Independent Security Evaluators who came to me with news of the flaws — and other security pros I spoke to about the study, published Tuesday. /You wouldn’t stop using a seat belt because it couldn’t protect you from every kind of vehicle accident. The same applies to password managers/.
#+END_QUOTE

(emphasis at the end is mine)

# Article hints that this is a Windows issue. Is this a Linux issue? 

I am no security expert, but it seems to me exploiting this vulnerability requires physical access. This means that someone would need to grab your computer while you're not watching, dump your RAM into a file, and run away with it before you come back in hopes it captured the right password. This is a much lower risk than a bad guy finding your reused "super safe password" you use for everything somewhere on the dark web, log into your bank account, your email, and your phone carrier's website, and convince your bank he's really you. But don't take it from me, take it from [[https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1099264185211539456][@SwiftOnSecurity]]. 

A good point there, as well: keyloggers (or similar) are actually more likely than a memory dump because they come bundled with most RATs out there and other Trojans people download from the web every day.  

# Yes? Do I understand this correctly? 

But who's going to listen anyway. I keep trying to get my partners on password managers, my family, and my friends. Almost no one buys in. My favorite argument of all time from an old classmate: "I feel safer remembering my passwords than some teenager hacker from Indonesia hacking into LastPass and stealing all my passwords." Of which she has probably no more than 7.  

Sigh.

17:42. Almost time to go home. I've been trying to hold on a bit longer, to tell myself I should around more before I buy it. Elite is complex, with a steep learning and no real objectives in sight. I was worried it'll be more work after work. So of course, I bought it. 
 
#+hugo: more

The first time I heard about Elite was on [[https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/990638636763840513][Twitter, from one of the famed infosec folks I follow]]. Then I heard about a bunch of players on an [[https://www.pcgamer.com/over-8000-elite-dangerous-pilots-are-embarking-on-an-incredible-18-week-journey/][epic journey to the other side of the galaxy]], especially when I realized this was a gamer-community driven event. This was also around the time I started watching Twitch streams more often, looking for a game that is more than just another hack and slash. Eventually, a few weeks ago, I started watching [[https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Elite:%2520Dangerous][Elite streamers]]. 

I had no idea how beautiful the game was. I didn't prepare myself to watch streamers for long periods (something I didn't know before), glued to the screen and asking questions. And then I found [[https://www.twitch.tv/thepavehawker/videos][Pave]].

Pave is a real-world USAF veteran who now makes a living streaming Elite 8 hours a night, /every/ night. I know, because I've been watching him for a week, glued to the screen until my head started bobbing up and down and then up again as sleep took over. 

Armed with his mug of Joe, a classic story-teller voice, and patience tougher than nails, Pave explained everything I asked him to the littlest detail. No question was too dumb or too long. Everything was explained. The more he explained, the more I learned just how vast and /complex/ Elite is. Go ahead and try him: just ask him what joystick he uses, and why he mispronounces its name, or what (in his opinion) are the best controls to play the game. Pave has been playing the game since 2015, and it shows. Watching him maneuvering around a space station looking for the landing pad or zigzagging his way in a dogfight, the guy has skills that kept me coming back for more every day.

When a game creates streamers like Pave, you know something must be right about it. When a game has been in existence (in one shape or another) since 1984, you know you're looking at a true classic. And when players form a group that [[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/][goes on epic journeys to save other players]], you know you got a game that brings the best out in people. 

So you know. I thought it wouldn't hurt to try it...

[[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=7903][Irreal's response to almost going completey paperless]] was bothering me some, and I felt a comment would be to constrained to include my thoughts. The main issue for me was not the original post on [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=7899][going digital]], but the explination. 

**** risks of all eggs in one basket: missing the point

need to be careful of calling it "risks". To me, it's less about a risk and more of the idea of giving my data, and giving it to one entity. The argument for me is privacy. Sure, we all give up privacy in one way (I have Android and google), but to what point. I try to make an effort to get /away/ from it, where Irreal seems to make an effort to get more /into/ it. 

**** about having money

This goes into brands and products. Irreal is an Apple guy. He mostly uses an iPhone and writes on an Apple device. To me, there was always something a bit "off" about people using their Macs to run Emacs, and I think now I understand why: Emacs is free and availble to everyone, Macs are the exact opposite. 

This goes back to my days as a teacher in a charter shcool, where the teachers were given Macbook Airs (back when these were excellent machines) and students were given Chromebooks. Personally, I consider both to be excellent machines. The students got cheap Chromebooks, but that's because many students abused these machines and destroyed them. As a teacher that works with students who often came from poor familes who could not afford food, I felt ashamed carrying around a shiny machine that eventually just needed to run the same Google Apps that worked just as well on the Chromebooks. 

I now work at a large institution where many of our US-based customers have more afluent backgrounds, and it shows with their new shiny Macbook Pros. Even though I'm considered the go-to person for Mac issues in my team, and even though I carry an iPhone and work on a Mac regularly, I don't feel at home on these the same way I don't feel myself when I wear a suite and a tie. To me, this is not what technology /should/ be. 

**** The real risks 

The idea of going paperless is not new to me. I first learned about it from [[https://www.jamierubin.net/going-paperless/][Jamie Rubin]] who was (is?) Evernote embessasdor. Back in 2014, I too used Evernote for everything and I love thast product. Until I didn't. 

Today Evernote increased it's premiums and with it limitations on free accounts. It's CEO, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Libin][Phil Libin]], has long left Evernote to chase more lucertive opprtunities in a Silicon Vally focused on investments. And my account, which contains a few gigs of my memories, had to be librated by paying money first to afford the premium of downloading it all. 

It's not that I don't have the money. It's not that I was shocked to learn that Evernote was after this money the whole time. It's the fact that this company could and did whatever it wanted with my data. /My/ data. Apple has the same ability, on a much larger scale, and they're already abusing it. Google does as well, of course, and so does Facebook, and the list goes on. 

The dilema of all eggs in one basket is not physical risks to losing it; it's the dilema of losing your ideas and identity to some virtual entity. 

- - - 

# stuff that didn't make it:


It's something else entirely the fact that I need to /buy/ the ability to express my own ideas. This is why I use Linux, this is why my blog runs on Hugo and not on a paid Wordpress service (even though there's still work to do to get off of github), and this is why I will never be able to use Apple machines for long periods. 





As an IT guy at the same school later, I fet bad knowing how poor the security is on these Macs (human compoent) and indeed, some students took adventage of this. The Chromebooks, on the other hand, where much harder to temper with. 






 Two months ago I bought my mother a new Chromebook, and it's a gourgerous beatiful machine with a touch screen and backlit keyboard that puts her old Mac to shame. At the time though, I couldn't run scripts on the Chromebook, MS RMD is minimal at best on a Chromebook, and other reasons that made it hard to use.

After a few months of research, I finally upgraded my Audio system on my PC. As it turns out, it wasn't as expensive as I feared. The renewed interest in music took me in rewarding directions of sound exploration I did not anticipate.
 
 #+hugo: more

**** First Steps: FLAC Files

As a teenager, I was first introduced to sound on a computer with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster][Sound Blaster]] back in the 90s in the first [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)][Prince of Persia]] game. Until then I was not aware computers could produce better sounds than 8-bit beeps. Music, up to that point, was either somewhat of low quality on the radio or high quality through a stereo system which my dad owned at the time. 

that experience made me believe that if I want to get serious about audio today, I can't start my journey just by looking at better headsets. As [[https://www.rousette.org.uk/][one of my favorite bloggers]] BSIAG wrote to me in an email: "the best way is to start with improving the source, and work your way towards the output (speakers or headphones)."

The first step sounded easy enough: using lossless [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC][FLAC]] files instead of MP3s and other lossy-compressed formats that are usually available on popular streaming services. But, if the popular streaming services (like Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Music) do not provide lossless audio, how do you get the good stuff? 

The Library. Armed with my card, I ordered a couple of CDs from the online catalog to be delivered to my local branch. I picked up a few recordings, and after quick research settled on [[https://abcde.einval.com/wiki/][ABCDE]] (that's "A Better CD Encoder". Catchy, eh?) to rip the CDs into FLAC format. It did a fine job, [[http://www.andrews-corner.org/linux/abcde/abcde_lossless.html][connecting to CDDB to find artists names and downloading album art as well]]. I repeated the process for a few classical CDs, exploring different sounds. I also tried a few CDs I already owned and learned an important lesson: many modern CDs are already created flat and prepared for loudness. In these cases, FLAC format did not do much to the sound quality. In other words, if you listen to Marlyn Manson's beautiful people on a streaming service or a CD, there's virtually no difference in the richness of the sound. That's because the richness I'm speaking of is present in the variation of different volume levels of parts of the track. For example, the artist's breathing, their finger sliding on the strings, certain bass sounds, etc. have different level volumes which make the track more whole and "multi-dimensional" where a processed recording often flattens it out, usually drowning the other sounds out completely. This is why, perhaps, some people swear that live recordings are much better; in-studio recordings are more proccessed and hence probably flatter.

I'm lucky to have a sound engineer in the family who loves and works with indie artists for the most part. When I told him about my quest toward better music, he pointed me at [[https://bandcamp.com/][Bandcamp]]. 

Bandcamp is a site that pays artists directly and much more than streaming services do. At the same time, it keeps digital works in FLAC format for download. You pay for a CD, usually as much as you want, and the Music is yours to save on your computer with the artist's thanks and blessing. Bandcamp remembers what CDs you bought and slowly suggests new artists and people who follow them for more music. For the last month or so I found myself doing something I haven't done in decades: buying music albums. My growing collection already includes 10 digital albums that make want to come back home and do nothing more than sit in my chair, close my eyes, listen and enjoy. 

**** Equipment: DACs, AMPs, and Getting my Headset

Another thing BSIAG helped me with is to solidify the concept of a DAC ([[https://www.whathifi.com/advice/dacs-everything-you-need-to-know][Digital to Aanalog Converter]]). Until that point, I knew there's this "box" serious music lovers and sound engineers connect their ultra-expensive headset. As it turns out, there's a whole world of technology behind DACs and AMPs. 

I can't go deep into it here because I have only basic understanding of it myself, but the general idea is that DACs convert the digital information (think 1s and 0s) in your computer to analog (wave-like, the stuff we can actually hear) information. All modern computers and phones come with a built-in DACs (which is why you can just plug in a pair of earphones directly into your iPhone, for example), but these are very basic. an AMP (or simply an amplifier) is a device that amplifies certain signals - in our case, sound signals. Why would you need all this volume pushing into your head? Isn't it a bad idea? 

Well, turns out high-quality headphones /resist/ the electrical current more than cheap ones. I'm not sure about the exact science behind this, but it's measured in impedance. Better (and usually more expensive) headphones = higher resistance (impedance) = more power (stronger AMP). There's much more to this than I'm explaining here. take a look at this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDbh7yDVFL8][YouTube video]] that explains some of these concepts if you're interested.

By the time I was ready to buy the DAC and the headphones, my partner got a job offer from a professional audio store in mid-town Manhattan, [[https://audio46.com/][Audio46]]. I've heard good things about this place from the same family guy (har har) who told me about Bandcamp, and now that a visit to the store came with a lunch-date with my partner, there was no excuse not to check the place out. And I'm happy that I did. I don't want to just blast them with praises (obviously I'm not objective) but a few things are important to note. First, they didn't move a dollar beyond the budget I specified. These things are expensive, and as a person who's only entering this world of sound, I'm probably a good target for folks to get me to buy expensive equipment I may or may not need. Not here. I gave my price range and they made sure to stay in that range. Second, I was able to choose and try on several headphones with my own music before committing to anything, and let me tell you, I took my time (at the end of the visit I was told some people can try different equipment for hours). Their patience and ability to gracefully work with other customers while still checking on me is a different experience than the kind you get in  Best Buy, for sure. Third, knowledge. Some of the things I explained above were completely alien to me before I walked into this store. It wasn't just a shopping experience, it was a learning experience as well. 

I ended up buying the basic but popular [[https://audio46.com/products/fiio-q1-mark-ii-native-dsd-dac-amp-headphone-amplifier-for-iphone-ipod-ipad][FIIO Q1]] for a DAC, which works on my phone just as well as it works on my computer, and a pair of the [[https://audio46.com/products/beyerdynamic-dt-880-600-ohm-premium-headphones][Beyerdynamic DT-880]]. Because I'm starting out, I wanted something that would also work on my phone when I'm traveling or want to listen to music on the go and not just at home. The guy at Audio46 gave me a pair of the 32 OHMs, which might not be as high-end as the 250 and the 600 OHMs, but I agree with the phone-also consideration. As I grow in my audiophile-ish ways, this pair (and probably the DAC) will become my mobile kit, while I'd get something more serious for home only that (I assume) will require more power than from a USB port alone. With this particular set I can't pick up the difference between 320kbps mp3 and a lossless wav in this [[https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/02/411473508/how-well-can-you-hear-audio-quality][NPR test]], but I picked up the difference between 128kbps and the rest every time. In Google Music though, I could hear a difference between my FLACs and the same files after uploading them to the service, which compresses them to 320kbps, right away. So maybe Google compresses harder than it lets you know. Whatever the case, I'm very satisfied with my growing lossless FLAC collection.    

**** Rediscovering Music

After almost two weeks with my new equipment, I think the biggest self-upgrade I got out of it is rediscovering music that I like and appreciating the artists who made it. I've found artists that create amazing music on Bandcamp like [[https://brunosanfilippo.bandcamp.com/][Bruno Sanfilippo]] and [[https://thevirtualconductor.bandcamp.com/][Eamonn Watt]]. I discovered a new use for my reading corner, which now doubles as my listening corner. It's very relaxing to close my eyes after a day at work in front of computers all day and just let the music flow in for a few minutes; It's like taking a mental shower. This was an important upgrade, and I'm very happy I finally took this step.

# Expand in source

# in the [[https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/02/411473508/how-well-can-you-hear-audio-quality][NPR test]] I wasn't able to tell the difference between non-compressed and 320MP3, though 128MP3 stood out in suckness. 


# ** Source (Bandcamp)
# But getting hifi good indie music on the cheap is not the only benefit of the site. As I started using it more and more, I discovered it has a daily and a weekly newsletter (on the site itself) with new and listen-worthy artists. As you learn which artists you like more, you can get more similar music from artists that follow and recomment the artist you like. This resulted in some great music I would have never dicovered from streaming services, which seem to always repeate a select few "seed" songs that create random play lists (not to mention, the streaming music on these sites is of lower quality, usually 128kbs MP3s).

I recently tried [[https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el][Org-Gcal]] a second time just to turn it off again. I was following the (now slightly outdated) [[https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-26-gcal/][instructions]] on [[https://cestlaz.github.io/][Mike Zamansky's]] blog and managed to get it working this time, but I found the end result messy and cumbersome. This is mostly because of how I use org and my agenda to quickly get a view of what I need, not really a reflection on the tool itself. It made me understand how different the methodology of Google calendar and Org-mode are.   

#+hugo: more

First, what exactly is Org-Gcal? 
It's an Emacs package that allows Org-mode to sync with Google calendar. Unlike other solutions, Org-Gcal works both ways, so you can create an event on Google calendar and have it show on your Org agenda, and vice versa. 

As much as I enjoy Org-mode, it's hard to eliminate Google calendar usage completely for a few reasons. First, Google calendar is a smart and mature product that is integrated into Android. Your Google Assistant, if you use it, can quickly create an event for you complete with location and invitations sent to contacts with a simple voice request. If you let it, the assistant can read what's on your screen and suggest an event, build routines for you, and quickly save important dates and reminders. Further, as an owner of a Google Home, it's nice to ask about your agenda for the day and be reminded of your meetings and tasks. Google Calendar is also a tool that quickly works with others, whether they use an Android device or an iPhone. an invitation via email is usually a seamless affair. 

When I attempted Org-Gcal for the first time, I got stuck with my Google account authorization token. I use two different Google accounts on a regular basis, and I ended up requesting access on the wrong account. When I discovered that issue I retraced my steps but got stuck somewhere in the middle. I wasn't able to get to the point of asking for another token from the other account, so I didn't manage to authorize the right account, and I gave up for a bit. 

The second time, something similar happened and I got stuck with a specific HTML error that ended up leading to that wrong token. This time, after digging around a bit, I found where Org-Gcal stores that token (in =~/.emacs.d/org-gcal/.org-gcal-token=) and deleted it. This caused Org-Gcal to ask for a new token, which I was now able to provide it with. Since I was following the instructions mentioned above, the setup came with two hooks to cause automatic sync with Google calendar whenever I saved my agenda or org file. I soon started seeing my events live, and then I've experienced a couple of issues. 

First, each event started repeating multiple times on the org file dedicated to syncing. This was because, I think, Org-Gcal works both ways and it pasted to events from Emacs to Google Calendar and then again from Google Calendar to Emacs. I noticed some events started repeating even more than twice. 

Second, and this is a harder issue to fix, is the lack of details I got from events posted from Org-mode. On my agenda, my events have a title completed with a location and a link to that location completed with a tag for the person I'm with. For example, "Breakfast at Tiffany @ [[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/travel/tiffany-and-co-jewelry-breakfast-audrey-hepburn.html][Tiffany]]      ::Tiffany::" conveniently shows me what I'm doing, where, and with who in online line on my agenda. It's crystal clear, and with quick =C-c C-o= I can check the location, get direction, and later even have a journal link connected to it. When converting to Google calendar event, this would result in a long title with the link's syntax square brackets, the location of the event left blank, and useless timestamp information in the details section. Of course, this is how it's intended to works. While I didn't expect miracles, this did make me realize that "translating org" to Google is not just a technical manner. it's a different /style/ entirely. It is just so much easier to squeeze my Pixel2 (which activates the Assistant if I don't feel saying "hey Google") and say "Create a calendar invite, Dinner at Tiffany at Tiffany Diner with Tiffany today at 8 PM". Google Assistant will usually nail this on the first attempt. This is the /Google style/ and this is what it's really good at doing. If I need minor adjustments, like inviting Tiffany or correct the address, that's pretty easy too with the Android's contextual AI and suggestions. In short, things are more inviting this way than the straight sync the package offers. 

<br>
[[file:static/why-gcal-failed.png]]
<br>
This style difference is a pretty big gap to cross. Org-mode is private, quiet, at-my-computer (usually) planning, where Google assistant is not private (Google can say whatever they want). The Calendar, in a weird way, is also not really personal: it's usually intended to share with a different person. What I have on Org-mode is an event. An event can be personal, often enough summed up in my journal with my impressions. The difference is big enough philosophically speaking that I can create the same occurrence twice: once on my Google Calendar, and once in Org. Sure, this is mostly a waste of time. The difference is not always so black-and-white, but it's there. For now, I am creating my Google events manually after creating the Org-mode events.

I've been using Linux as my daily driver for the last three years. I work with Windows on a daily basis and I support Mac issues all the time, but I don't think I will ever go back to using either one for my personal data. As a matter of fact, it's Linux which made an appearance at work: without my VM and Org-mode, I would probably be drowning under hips of emails, meeting invites, support tickets, and the constant in-person walk-ins into our work environment. I throw everything I get at Org-mode to keep on top of the couple of tasks I try to tackle each day. 

It was always clear to me that I have things a bit backward. Linux Mint, which I use all the time, is trapped in a VM in a Windows-host which I only use for Games and entertainment (yes, I know you can play games on Linux. Trust me when I tell you I tried, and it's not there yet. Not for me, anyway). I've had an old [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Latitude][Dell Latitude 6430u]] laying around for a while as a backup and for travel. Big and bulky, it had Ubuntu installed, with much to be desired in the battery-power retention department.

A week ago, due to various issues with Microsoft Windows patching at work, I decided it's time to try and leave Windows behind again and let Linux run free. It took me a while to realize that one of my big setbacks have been that I wanted to keep my work setup. I love my mechanical keyboard and the crisp, ultra-wide screen. I enjoy working at my desk behind a closed door, [[https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/upgrading-audio-game][enjoying my music]]. Once I realized the main setback, the solution came easily: a KVM switch. After quick research, I found this [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078LY741V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][TESmart 4K HDMI KVM Switch USB2.0 Port]]. So far, it works wonderfully.

As I was setting the laptop up, another unexpected change took place: I gave up on Linux Mint and decided to try Manjaro. 

I say "gave up" because installing Linux Mint was never easy. For as long as I remember, on desktops and laptops, I always had difficulties booting Mint after install. It would install just fine, but when restarted, I ended up staring at a grub shell and couldn't go further. I've attempted difference things, starting from switching between Legacy and UEFI boot to using [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair][Ubuntu's boot repair tool]], but nothing really worked. I've spent hours on IRC trying to get help and I grew tired of describing the same process again and again in various forums trying to figure out what went wrong. This is why my laptop had Ubuntu to begin with, instead of Mint which was always my preferred distro. I never liked Ubuntu's "feel," and that Amazon symbol at the middle of my dock (yes, I know you can turn it off), was sticking out at me like a rusty for-profit nail.

I tried to install Linux Mint on my laptop again and ran into the same boot issue. I asked for help on the forums again and told myself I should wait until I get the help I need and solve this issue once and for all. But I've been hearing good things about Manjaro, and my fingers were itching, so I threw it all to hell and decided to go for it. I don't think I'm coming back. 

The first obvious good thing about Manjaro is that it worked without any issue after install, just like Ubuntu. No headaches, no asking for help, no forums, no nothing. The second major good thing, turns out, is that I chose the [[https://manjaro.org/download/kde/][Plasma KDE version]].

Mint has always been Cinnamon (which is a version of GNOME) for me. While Mint offers Plasma as well, I never tried it on Mint. I did test Plasma briefly with [[https://kubuntu.org/][Kubuntu]] at one point, but I wasn't impressed. Manjaro, on the other hand, seems to be amazing with it. Many of the the things I'm quickly learning to love in Manjaro (but not all) are Plasma-related, such as KDE connect (syncs notifications and texts with my phone), "hot corners" (one of the things I liked about macOS), Yakuake for quick pull-down terminal needs, and in general, the sleek modern design of the dark theme. It just /looks /good/. So far, any application that existed on Mint (which is based on Ubuntu's repositories) can work on Manjaro through its vast user/community libraries. Oddly enough, because Manjaro does not require additional repositories for additional software to be installed, the overall installation process for "Ubuntu/Mint applications" is even /smoother/ than it was on Mint itself. Speaking of software...  Manjaro has the latest version of almost everything, which means I am now running Emacs 26.2 instead of 25, the version I have on the Mint VM. I have a feeling Google Drive support will become useful for me soon.

I'm still working on the setup. For one, I need to re-wire everything and hide all the cords from sight. I also want to run an Ethernet cable from the laptop (having a bulky heavy laptop has advantages...) directly to the router for increased speeds and stable LAN connectivity for my SMB shares on my Windows machine, when I set them up. I also want to purchase another battery from eBay just in case. I've been running it without a battery connected directly to a power source. Currently, the CPU widget points at less than 25% usage (that is until I fire up Chrome...) and the laptop's lid is closed, in its "docked" state on my desk. If I want to go somewhere all I have to do is to attach the battery and disconnect it from the wires, and I have my Linux productivity setup with me ready to go in my backpack. No need for a thin sexy under-powered over-priced device here, we're doing juuuuust fine.

A few years back, I was an avid user of Evernote. That was a period of information "innocence" for me, before I knew much about Linux and switched careers to IT. Back then, Evernote was an amazing discovery. It was the first serious digital (and, to be honest, analog as well) system I built. I remember many nights where I drifted off to sleep thinking about how to tag and achieve my information in it. To this day I have plenty of memories stored away in its achieve files -- though they have been since downloaded and converted from the App's native format.

#+hugo: more

This morning, YouTube's algorithm picked up [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rNUpXYCcrA][a video from Evernote]] and threw it my way as a suggestion. It's a short introduction to a promised upcoming series from Evernote, called Behind the Scenes. Introduced directly by Evernote's current CEO, Ian Small, this seems to be an honest attempt to "take us behind the scenes... and show us what [Evernote] is working on."

Evernote is a for-profit company with a product that is very different than org-mode. While I have no desire or need to switch from org in the near future, it would be interesting to see what kind of challenges the makers of a popular note-taking app come up with. Who knows, perhaps I could learn a thing or two.

I had [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8004][irreal's post]] about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bfsck6/mu4e_for_dummies/][mu4e for dummies]] on my todo list for a week before I decided to give it up. At first, I thought it was because setting the time and following through the guide was too much of a "cloud" in my head to tackle, so I broke it down. Then, as I looked at the individual components, I realized it's more complicated then technicalities alone.

#+hugo: more

Org-mode has resolved an old problem for me I didn't know I have. Or, more precisely, I didn't know it was a problem because it was too big to grasp. It was the issue of identities and online accounts.

Emails are a good way to explain this issue. I currently have four active email accounts: my main Gmail one which is used for professional needs, financials, keeping in touch with family, etc. Then I have another Gmail account, which in the past was more specific for other endeavors such as creative writing and close friends. This became a more personal account which is now associated with my calendar. A third active account is my work email, in Outlook, which is probably the main account I'd like to use within Org-mode. I also have an account with proton mail, which I try to utilize more often with my GitHub and other techy things I do as I try to break away from the Google hold over my life. 

You're probably starting to see the issue here, and it doesn't really have to do with Emacs or mu4e.

I didn't instead to have four active email accounts, but this is how it is. While it's possible that others have no more than two email accounts which might fall into nice buckets of "personal" and "work," for me, these buckets happen within Org-mode. This is why it's such a critical part of my organization. Life is chaos. My job bleeds into my personal life. My technological passions bleed into work. I /need/ the barrier between emails and calendar for my Org-agenda, which contains /everything/ I want to do. Once I decide to put something on my agenda, it doesn't matter anymore where it came from. What matters is that it gets done. That's all.

Every now and then I discover (or re-discover) a tool in Linux that does exactly what I need it to do. Some examples include ffmpeg, to shrink down my self-recorded webcam journal session while increasing the volume; abcde, to rip a classical music CD to flac and find its exact title and name; youtube-dl, which downloads any video online I need along with aria to speed these downloads, and more. 

Today I want to praise a new excellent tool, this time for screenshots: [[https://flameshot.js.org/#/][Flameshot]].

[[file:static/2019-05-25.jpg]]

Flameshot is walking the thin line between being a heavy future-rich screen capture tool with all kinds of features (think  and the minimal screen-capture one that usually comes bundled with your distro. I think it manages to be "just enough" to do exactly what it needs to do. Nothing more, nothing less. 

It was easy enough to tie Flameshot to my print-screen button. When summoned, the entire screen becomes dark, and a little message asks me to drag my selection with the mouse. The resulting window, which you can see in the picture above, is a frame that can be adjusted by dragging its sides to crop exactly what you need. 

As you stretch the frame, the different tools buttons re-arrange themselves depending on the frame's size. It's a really nice feature which makes the whole application feel smooth and responsive. The wider the frame is, the more tools on the bottom. If the frame is really small, the tools will wrap all around the frame, creating a second row, as needed.

Flameshot comes with all the basic tools you need from an annotation application: arrows, lines, and now (finally) a text tool, which needs to first be activated from the tools configuration menu: (=$ flameshot config=). There's also a text-blur and upload to Imgur tool. Flameshot is minimal: there's no eraser button, for example, because it's not needed. You can only undo and re-do. The color palette is basic, without a large color wheel. You can't rotate and flip images; it trusts you to use a more "heavy guns" editing tool for that, reminding you it's there only for a screenshot.

It's an elegant tool, with an intuitive UI: right-click to choose a color; scroll to make the lines wider or thinner. When you choose the upload to Imgur button, for example, it automatically does that in the background and opens a window for you to either save, copy the freshly-created link to the clipboard or delete the image from the site, which opens another tab in your browser for that. This is the kind of application that makes you feel proud using it.

- - -

When I was reaching my 30s, I hit a jackpot. I secured a deal for a rent-controlled apartment in Morningside Heights in Manhattan. I had a job that didn't quite pay the bills, even for that, so I drove almost 900 miles to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to fetch a friend whom I convinced to live with me in the city. 

The apartment had three bedrooms, a living room, a dining area, a small kitchen (which I loved a lot) and a shower. It was packed with old furniture and dusty chachkies because its owner was about 80 years old. He asked me to wire rent money to his account every month, left me with a key, and left for Florida. 

I've met, dated, and enjoyed many women during that period. I had professional dominatrix taking photos naked on my dinner table (I had to help them put on corsets), and I had a high school girl who I was afraid was underage (she wasn't) take a shower with me. I had a woman come over to have sex with both me and my friend-turned-roommate, and another who had an orgasm telling me I'm gay while penetrating me with her fingers. All remarkable, all faded out of my life as quickly as they came. 

A few years later, in a different apartment, I wasn't able to keep paying the rent. For the first time in decade, I had to move in with my mother, who moved to Manhattan by then. My mother's apartment had only one bedroom, a long hallway, and a living room. The kitchen was a corner carved out of the hallway and had strong fluorescent lights. I remember this because the lights and the noise of dishes woke me up every morning when my mother started making coffee a few inches away from the sofa on which I slept.

I've dated almost no one during that time. As a matter of fact, I can remember only two. That's because when I moved (with my mother) to another apartment, the relationships I started forming on top of the sofa with these two moved with it.  I graduated from the sofa to the bedroom. My mother, coincidentally, found a boyfriend in Pennsylvania and was away or most of the week. I noticed how slowly, with a stable job, better clothes, and the aforementioned status upgrade, I started dating more people again. Not as many - there wasn't much time and less energy - but it was a steady rising slope. The new people I've dated came and went. The job, also, quickly transformed into a new career. The two partners and the sofa remained.

It's funny how you think all you want is to be able to keep fucking everyone (figuratively and literally) but what you actually want is companionship. It's something we as a society keep shoving into everyone's throat, yet somehow, doesn't seem to stay in anyone's skull. Yet, it's the fear of being alone, completely alone, that we often afraid the most. I know because I'm an as introvert as they come, but even I have to admit that my life is a hollow shade of gray without the color these two relationships brought to my life. These connections shape us, make us who we are as adults, and eventually, these connections are also what is remembered when we are gone. there's nothing as painful as losing such a connection. 

You can't make a relationship out of thin air. That's because a relationship is forged from common experiences that you often try to avoid. Embarrassing little moments. Painful memories. The terrifying realization that at some point (you can't be sure when) caring about that person is more important than caring for yourself. Then, the peace that comes with accepting this realization. You can't find this sort of experience on Tinder, even if you pay their premium. 

I never wanted to end up on my mother's sofa, and to be honest, I never wanted to end up in relationships with both of my partners. But just like the sofa, shit happens. This is who I am now, and who they are, and how we came to be. My partners, who I affectionately call patches, live with me now. We often enjoy a good movie sitting on that sofa, which is with us still.  I'm older, I'm scarred, I have way less patience than I used to have, and I like it all just the way it is, good and bad, sofa or no sofa.

Last Saturday I had an encounter with dear ol' Aunt Dee. She's like a lifelong buddy of mine, never too far. She's a shy quiet wall flower, sneaks up on you, undetected. You only realize she's around after her long scrawny hands are wrapped around you, hugging, her perfume brings back a daze of nostalgia...

I was playing another round of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities:_Skylines][Cities Skylines]], and realized I'm not much into the game anymore. As a matter of fact, I was forcing it for the last hour. I promised myself to go to gym, and a part of me was trying to use any possible excuse to keep me glued to that chair. It was gray and cold, it was a weekend after a hard week, I wasn't in the mood, I didn't eat enough, bla bla bla. I recognized this train of thoughts: "ah! I know you... you depression you, how have you been?" and checked my list. I think anyone who's been with dear aunt Dee for long enough has a similar list.

Sunday was different because I started it differently. The first thing I did was going back to my elements. This means, without getting all fancy about my life philosophy, that I did my morning exercise (few stretches, pull-ups, little weights) and meditation. I took my time before I set at the computer: first there was one round of exercise, then I made coffee, then a second round of exercise. Then there was meditation, which was a powerful mind-dump. I talked to myself about things that are important to me, things that I've neglected. Then the meditation itself, a series of deep breaths while counting. This is one of my life facts: when meditation is really needed, there's always strong resistance to it at start. By the end I don't want to finish it. Putting my mind on a state of neutral after emphasizing to myself things I care about is powerful. I'm far from being a meditation master and I don't read much on the matter, but this form of meditation always came naturally to me.

After that, Sunday started taking shape. I know so because my room started looking like my room again. First (it's always first) the bed. Then laundry. Then the closet, which was something I haven't dealt with in a while. Cleaning my room is similar to cleaning my head. It's odd, a made bed makes me feel so much better. I don't know why, but I don't argue, it works. Later on I went to gym again, this time without a long struggle. Later still, I enjoyed sharing a different video game, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn][The Return of the Obra Dinn]], with my partner. 

This time I didn't game as an exercise in solitude and forgetfulness. It was a mutual experience of puzzle solving. In retro respect, it reminds me of my grandparents playing bridge together, only with more high fives and laughs. There's something special about sharing something as intimate as a video game with someone who's been around long enough to share such an intimate thing with. Those of you who game know what I'm talking about: getting someone into your bed is not as nearly as intimate as having someone by your side while you play a video game, let along take an active part of it. My partners are the only people alive who can grab the mouse or the phone out of my hand mid-action and not encounter the scorning disdain on my face. 

Somewhere between the meditation, the game, the avocado salad/guacamole I've made, I found peace. Aunt Dee was gone, out of town, see-you-next-time. I've had a good day at work yesterday (not excellent, not awesome, just good). It's important that I mention it for myself, for next time, and for you, the other nephews of aunt Dee out there (or her relatives) who might find comfort in this.

Have a good rest of the week!

So, you've discovered it exists and people are calling it "poly," short for polyamourous. Not so fast dude! There are a few things you should know. 

# below, old post:

# Last night I browsed Reddit, which is my much-adequate replacement for Facebook and the [[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/technology/google-plus-security-disclosure.html][now-officially-dead Google Plus]]. A post that captured my eye was "[[https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/9wozci/for_the_recordits_way_easier_to_get_a_date_with_a/][For the record—it’s way easier to get a date with a man than with a woman]]" in the Polyamory subreddit. 

# I feel I can summarize the post in this statement the OP (original poster) made: 

# "Ive been using several apps, some of which (like 'Her') are women-only. What I’ve come to discover is that most women are EXTREMELY passive on dating apps." She is a bisexual 29 year old female.  

# My intension here is not to commet directly about the post itself (or the many comments under it it), but instead talk about my own experience as a CIS non-monogamous man nearing his 40s. 

So, you've discovered it exists and people are calling it "poly," short for polyamourous. Not so fast dude! There are a few things you should know. 

**** It Doesn't Get Easier

# The most difficult challange for me dating now than it used to be even 5 years ago is the age. Not my  age, but what age implies to the women I contact online. 

Women living a healthy polyamorous lifestyle after 35 are not exactly common compared to women in their 20s and even early 30s. Most women after 35 are looking for something "serious" and "long lasting," which usually means a monogamous long-term relationship that would at least lead in the direction of marriage. 

People also get generally more busy after 35. Work takes a large chunk of time, and by this point you'd have an idea of what you like to do and enjoy putting time into it. People who are passionate about what they do is important in dating, as you'd find out. You better stay away from the bitter ones who suck your life energy away, and they in turn will also stay away from you if you're bitter. This will make things more challanging as you get to know someone and want to spend more time with them (and hopefully, them with you). Work and other life aspect often get in the way, and juggling more than one relationship multiply the difficulty level at least by two. 

**** The Mainstream

Polyamory is a common term now and it's being thrown around without care. At one time, you got the stage to discuss what polyamory means to you as a person over coffee with a facinated date who would look at you wide-eye. Now you find that the person at the other side of the table, who sometimes never paracticed polyamory, already knows what polyamory is and will explain its mean to /you/. It doesn't matter that your version is different or that their idea is full of pop-colutre references they picked up from their good friend Ashley; their version is the right version and that's that. 

**** Physical Attraction

People don't usually get more physically attractive as they get older. It's funny, how far folks go out of their way sometimes not to mention that they don't find you attractive. You'd find that the truth burns much less as you get older, and that you appriciate the honesty and the quick treatment much more than polite ghosting. 

Look, Fact is you're not a super model. I'm not saying you're ugly, because you're not, and many /will/ find you attractive. All I'm saying is, know your comptition. Where most popular dating apps and events in real life have a 10:1 ration of man to availble women, each women has options, and those option would often lean toward younger, toner, sexier. Can you blame them? Try not to take it personally and move on. 

The other side of the coin is this: don't settle for women you don't find attractive - and notice I said attractive, not physically attractive. That's a fine line to walk. You can take a certain "hit" in physical attractiveness if someone is otherwise funny, fun, sexy, good, etc. But only that much if we assume you're still interested in sex. And don't feel bad about it either. We live in a country where obsidity is not just an epedemic, it's also sometimes justified (not medically speaking) and god help you if you speak against it. There's the [[http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight][WHO's BMI calculations]] which are pretty good at giving you an idea when someone is "really" just fat, not chubby, if you ever have a doubt. Don't use it as a guide, use it as a factor in your calculations. 

**** Sex

Sex and its meaning is something we should definitely talk about more openly. If it's not on the table, which often means end of dating, so be it. If it is under certain understandings as it often is, it should be discussed. It is a topic that often disappears into a lingering question mark. Some like to call this a tease, but I don't. Teasing, I believe, is something that happens /after/ people are comfortable enough to put sex on the table. Otherwise, why waste feelings and time? Even at times where we're not sure sex will take place (this happens to me often enough), it is fine to say so. Something like "look, I don't want to get your hopes up, I'm just not sure yet. Can we take it easy one more time or two?" is perfectly fine. If it isn't, you'd better go look for someone else. I would. 


# Even on Tinder, an app that is assumed to be more for hooking up and not for settling down, this pattern is very clear. Most women evaporate (they suddenly disapear from the app on my end altogether, which implies I'm being blocked) as soon as they understand I am a non-monogamist. This understanding comes, on Tinder at least, when they take the time to look at my profile (it's the first line) or when I explain it. We can sometimes have a converstion that extands to texts for a day or two, and then suddenly not a word when the understand of what the term means hits them. This last example is rare, but it happens; what important to note is that there's an extremly small portion of women who would carry on a conversation after what me (and other poly folks) call "drop the poly bomb". 

# On OKCupid, the crowd generally is more careful with profiles. Even then though, women who would match up well with me (92% and above) would often describe non-monogamy as not something they personally appose to, but at the same time, not for them. OKC has altarted its dating filtering to cater better for non-monogamous folks a couple of times. There "seeing someone" relationship status for those who date openly has been around for a while. More recently, the site made the realtionship status stand out more, making it easier to find people who marked their profile as "non-monogmaous". Still though, the number of women who mark themselves as non-monogmous in NYC is fairely small in my age group. I am not sure how much my own profile filters some due to low percentage, but I doubnt the imapct is so large that only one profile in about 10 shows as non-monogamous. 


# It's important to mention that I did not bother with all these details in the past. It seemed that women in general were much more willing to experiment, try new things, and date. Many times (but not always) this meant sexually. I think it's worth mentioning here that some of these women became friends even after we stopped dating romantically. I'm in touch with them to this day. If I am to guess (which is all I can do, this is my theory) I would say this has to do with what women (in general) are brought up to believe and, unfortuantely, "trained" for. Others still are looking for a "primary" partner who would treat them as the main anchor in the relationship and consider anyone else "seconadry." To me, this is not polyamory as much as it is a "reformed" monogamy of sorts. Many would appose, of course. To each their own. 

**** Priorities and Specifics

# Another important aspect is diciplines of life at this point. For many, me including, work takes a large chunk of time. For the most part, I like it this way. I am passionate about my job and the passion often bleeds into my personal life. People who are passionate about what they do is important in dating. From my experience, when I date women who love what they do, it shows in everything.  

# It so follows that women I want to date have similar priorities. In turn this leads to challanges, such as time managment, proximity (sometimes down to block radious in the city), certain amount of wealth, education and more. While I often feel I must be more flexible about my priorites, it seems the women I talk to do not. This is a simple case of supply and demand. I've talked to several women and I know that comparing my OKC inbox to theirs would be like comparing a flower in a pot in your living room to a meddow full vagitation, including the unwanted weed that grows everywhere. 

# I have previously asked in the polyamory reddit for advice from women regarding how to reach to more of them. I was positively surprised at the amount of comments I recieved: most women who responded mentioned that the big issue is time and commitment. In other words, the fact that I'm busy with work and already have fulltime partners mean that I have little time for a new partner. That would be very true if the women I speak to would /know/ I have two full time partners and that I am very busy, but generally, they do not My profile specifies that I'm a non-monogmaous and generally busy, but I stay away from details until asked later. There's no reference to my partners and my relationship with them. This is not because I hide this information (I would gladly talk about it with a person I date), but because my partners have their own private lives as well, and my dating profile is not and should not be tied to them. 

# However, In the past I used to connect to my partners' profile, and that made little to no difference. I found then that most women would not read as far into the profile to get to these details. They would just message me, curious about polyamory in general. I would often find myself in a position of explaining what it is and how it works. Times have changed.  

**** Mainstream

# When I started dating as a non-monogamist, polyamory was a magical word. It was a term wispered at dark bars after a BDSM party died down, speaking of "another way" and a "lifestyle" that was never explained thoroughly. It would also be a term you would not dare mention for fear of being discovered at work and in the family. For some, this is still true, but the number is lowering every day.

# We live in a different world now. Polyamory is a term that officially exists in dating apps and TV shows. The number of people who haven't heard of it before is decreasing fast. The good side of this is that we can talk about it, we can make it better, we don't need to be afraid of being judged and even have the power to take countermeasures if we are descriminated against. 

# But the other part of going mainstream is the flatness. Polyamory is so common of a term now that it's being thrown around without care, and (in my opinion) without full understanding of what it means individually to each person. Where once you got the stage to discuss what polyamory means to you as a person over a drink with a facinated date, now you find that the person at the other side of the table, who sometimes never paracticed polyamory fully, already knows what polyamory is. Oh yes, they have a full definition, tied to judgment and a plan of action, just because you mention the word. You don't get to explain, they explain it /to you/. 

# What is left is often to shake my head and turn my back. There's no talking to a wall, or a glass that is already full, as the famous zen saying goes. When I meet someone who flat out insist they don't  want to be a "unicorn" or a "secondary" or (worst of all) a cheating secret without the patience to listen, I just walk away. I tried to talk some sense into these people, but I stopped wasting my time. It never ends well. 

**** Attraction

Physical attraction is a big factor. I find it funny  how far we go out of our way sometimes not to mention this. It would seem we are so careful not to hurt anyone's feelings, and by doing so we hurt oursevles in the long run. 

The fact is, I don't find most of the women who are interested in me online attractive. There's hardly anything new or weird about this statement when you think about, yet, it just sounds so /bad/. Why is that? 

I do not think I have high standards. I am not attracted to obese women, though in some cases overwight is OK. I think [[http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight][WHO's BMI calculations]] is overall a pretty good guide for what I call overweight, if you're curious. I've tried to force myself to date obese and overwight women before and ended up being miserable, or made them misrable as a result. the temption, due to despair, can be overwhelming at times.

Other factors that go into attraction for me include less body hair in general, but I do not have any hard lines here. Smell and hygine are important to me. That's mostly it. It seems the women I date have far stricter requierments in this area, but I wouldn't know for sure. This is not often discussed as I hope it would,  even if I ask directly. My conclusion then is based on what I see on profiles, comments such as "please be fit," or "only groomed beards" and the like. Among the more hidden features (those are the kind that are not posted on the profile or discussed openely, sometimes never) the height issue seems to be a big deal: Most women want their partner to be taller than they are.

I've dated a tall woman once who, after a few months and a couple of sexual intercourses, finally came to the conclusion that the height differene /does/ in fact bothers her. She was somewhat surprised herself, it was a discovery she has made and shared with me. We have developed a friendship strong enough by then to respect one another to admit such things (we still are friends). She mentioned that the real realizion was not the fact that the height difference bothered her; it was the fact that she had /resisted/ acknologing it is such a big deal for so long. She saw herself as accepting and open minded, and having a problem with a height was betraying this image of herself. In other words, she wouldn't allow herself to admint she is not attracted to shorter men.

For calrification, I'm 5'6''. Definitely not the tallest out there, but there are many women my height or lower. This was never a real problem, I'm using it here as an example for a hidden feature as I explained earlier. 

**** Sex

Finally I want to address sex /means/. Most of us date with sex on the mind, to one degree or another. Of course there are asexual folks and those who use dating apps to create stirctly social connections, but in general this is rare. For a long time, I struggeld with the fact of bringing sex up on my profile. I have a somewhat of a BDSM background, and I'm not new to what is generally considered "kinky" sex. What this means, interestingly, is that I often bring sex up as a conversation topic. Because this is a personal and sensitive issue, I would ask a permission first, and naturally, I need to be comfortable myself. This doesn't usually happen on the first date, but it can. 

As an average CIS male (whatever average means), it seems I usually crave sex more often then those I date. However, it seems women crave sex just as much but are hold back from bringing it up. This ties to a familiar pattern of what wanting sex means to a woman, or, as a friend of mine would often say when I talk to her, what it still unfortunately means to women to "admit" wanting sex. I strongly agree that we still judge women who openly seek sex too harshly, but for now, this reality means most women won't be comfortable discussing sex opently before we get intimate, which in my opinion, is a disadventage. I should also mention that there are women who offer sex (or sexual connection) right off the bat, basically the equivilant of "dick pictures" just with female parts. In each case this happened to me, the woman is desperate and unattractive - physically or mentally.

When I was more involved in the "kink scene," sex was everywhere, and therefor, it was nowhere. Everyone had nude pictures on their profile and tell you what gets them off if you'd ask (with permission, of course). I found this libarating. I could know how someone would look like under their clothes and thus very simple to get laid if the interest was mutual. Interistingly though, usually there was /less/ of rush to get there.  You both knew what was down there, you both knew you want to get here eventually, so you both ended up getting a drink and talking it over and build something that would /include/ rather than lead to sex.  

Unfortnately I since stopped being as active. Partly due to time constraints, but mostly due to age. Many of these groups are strongly enfourced by an age limit that wouldn't allow a man my age to join a group of people in their 20s, for example. This is a good rule, and is there for a good reason. Work is often another thing that gets in the way, especially if you like what you do. It's just not as appealing to be an hour late and show up with a hangover to work. Been there, done that, no thank you kind of deal. 

In my opinion, Sex and its meaning is something we should definitely talk about more openly. If it's not on the table, which often means end of dating, so be it. If it is under certain understandings as it often is, it should be discussed. It is a topic that often disappears into a lingering question mark. Some like to call this a tease, but I don't. Teasing, I believe, is something that happens /after/ people are comfortable enough to put sex on the table. Otherwise, why waste feelings and time? Even at times where we're not sure sex will take place (this happens to me often enough), it is fine to say so. Something like "look, I don't want to get your hopes up, I'm just not sure yet. Can we take it easy one more time or two?" is perfectly fine. If it isn't, you'd better go look for someone else. I would. 

**** Where are we 

At this point in my life, dating people is at it's hardest. The only time in my life I recall dating being as challanging was my early 20s, where I was still a clueless virgin who tried to do everything "by the book." Life had different plans, as it often does, and I ended up the complete opposite direction which thankfully shocked me out of that stupid daze. 

I am a consitant person, and I belive in keeping on trying a forumla that generally works. This is what I intend to keep on doing. One of the things I know I should start doing again though is turning back to the kink scene and find positive people in it. That has been the best becon in the past, and I believe it could once again in the future.

This past week has been a good example of emotional exhaustion. Because influences overall productivity, relationships, and health (both mental and physical) I'd like to discuss it here.

**** Defining What it is

I started this post looking for a good definition for a burnout, which is what I thought I was experiencing. Turns out, I was wrong. Like other terms that describe a relative and immeasurable state of emotions, burnout is a definition of a situation that gets overused and eventually dismissed as a dramatic conversation emphasis. After a short research, I found the following definition from [[http://dictionary.sensagent.com/][Sensagent]]:

#+Begin_quote
The most well-studied measurement of burnout in the literature is the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Maslach and her colleague Jackson first identified the construct "burnout" in the 1970s, and developed a measure that weighs the effects of emotional exhaustion and reduced sense of personal accomplishment. This indicator has become the standard tool for measuring burnout in research on the syndrome. The Maslach Burnout Inventory uses a three dimensional description of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. Some researchers and practitioners have argued for an "exhaustion only" model that sees that symptom as the hallmark of burnout.
#+end_quote 

This definition and the link above led me to more research which focused on additional causes of burnouts, most notably depression and a sense of lack of accomplishment and/or purpose. Because I'm familiar with these emotional states as well, I recognized these feelings were /not/ present this week. I felt very tired and drained, but I did not feel sad or lacking a purpose. As a matter of fact, I felt focused (to the point of overdoing things, part of the reason for exhaustion) and very productive at work. I was pleased with my achievements this week and my interactions with colleagues were better than usual. 
I then settled on this definition, from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_exhaustion][Wikipedia]]: 

#+begin_quote
Emotional exhaustion is a chronic state of physical and emotional depletion that results from excessive job demands and continuous stress. It describes a feeling of being emotionally overextended and exhausted by one's work. It is manifested by both physical fatigue and a sense of feeling psychologically and emotionally "drained".
#+end_quote

We can conclude that emotional exhaustion is a symptom or a part of a burnout. Exhaustion /can lead/ to a burnout, which has the additional effects that were earlier discussed (like a sense of lack of purpose, cynicism, depression, etc.) This is important because it serves as a way to contain the problem so other areas that do not require examination at this point are left out.

**** Why Discussing Exhaustion is Important 

Attending certain activities require energy while others "charge" such energy. As a mostly introverted person who values quiet and privacy, social interactions require that I spend energy. Several activities on my personal calendar, such as attending a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%2526_Dragons][DnD]] session with friends, requires I spend a relatively high level of mental energy. Other activities, like working out at the gym, requires a different kind of mental energy and a level of physical energy. In sate of emotional exhaustion, both are depleted and prevent me from doing these activities. In turn, giving up on something that is highly important to me (going to the gym) leads to a feeling of guilt and self-blame which is another step toward overall burnout. 

To make a long story short, exhaustion means you're doing less overall and could lead to further physical and mental problems that in turn mean you're even less productive.

**** Causes

Before we can talk about "fixing" exhaustion, we should probably discuss what is the source of the problem. In my case, the source of emotional exhaustion is work. This is very common, and again, may be overused and overstated. Therefore, I turn to concrete symptoms. A simple series of yes/no questions: 

1. Have I worked extra time?
2. Did I have additional responsibilities at work than usual?
3. Do I feel physically tired, to the point of napping or going to sleep extra early?
4. Is there increasing need to be left alone and rest (recharging)? 

For the week that passed, the answer for all of the above is yes. 

**** Fixing the Issue

How do you "fix" your car when you run out of gas? How do you "fix" your phone when the battery is drained? The answer is indeed obvious. The problem is that recharging is not always an option. 

It may be the weekend (finally) but there are other responsibilities and plans that are waiting since you did not have time to deal with these during the week. For me, it is also very possible to fall back on habits that waste time rather than recharge or recharge efficiently. that are not necessarily as recharging as they are just a cause of exhaustion. For example, playing video games until very late at night might feel like recharging, when in reality what is really needed is sleep and a physical/mental break from the computer screen. In turn, this also requires energy (discipline) which I may already be lacking because of the exhaustion. What do we do then? 

1. Divide activities into time segments: Instead of just ignoring the world and watching 5 episodes of a TV show, break it to watch only one before getting up, walking around a bit, evaluating things.
2. Recognize true recharging activities: like sleep. Recognize that I need to be in bed at a certain time and finish with other activities.
3. Use friends / significant others: if you're lucky to live in with people who care about you, it's easy to reach out for a point of reference and have them help you and prevent you from sinking into something else completely. Have some tea time together. Talk. Cuddle. Take a walk with them.
4. Vent productively - find a way to let out your feelings in a way that feels productive and is worth your time. In my case, this post is that particular item.

**** Conclusion and Prevention

Sometimes, emotional exhaustion happens or can be triggered because of an environmental element that is not tied to your own habits. It is important to recognize that prevention is not as important as having a way to cope and work out of a situation when it does happen. Being prepared and having a plan to work with when needed is the most important thing.

Prevention may comes second but is also important. it's important to know what's coming and plan for it. This is one reason why I love [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode][Org-mode]]. Having a good tool is part of the job, using it is the other. For me, a good routine is to remote into my VM at work before I come in, turn on Org-mode, and sync my personal tasks. I then work from home looking at my day and evaluate what needs to be done. While this changes during the day, knowing what's coming gives me a top-down view of what a successful day should look like. In turn, this prevents a sense of lack-of-purpose and directly prevents me from sliding into burnout, as mentioned earlier. 

Another important prevention technique that I rediscovered is to disconnect several times during the workday. For me, a minimal break of 10 minutes is needed to "reset" and be able get out of the "tunnel vision" that I sometimes get while working. I work in a large enough environment that allows me to take walks inside the buildings regardless of the weather. I use the time to find a quiet corner and look outside and daydream a bit. In addition. the power of napping has amazing benefits. It's not always possible to find a spot to nap, but if I do, a quick dose of even 5 minutes around 15:00 (this is usually when the "crash" comes) can be immensely helpful. 

Finally, it's important to leave some empty time on your calendar. Some folks pencil in every possible day with activities, including the weekend. I know, for instance, that using my Saturday for activities with partners and family means I won't have Saturday to myself, so I give myself time Sunday. This is a luxury not many adults can afford, especially those with a family, But for me this is thankfully not an issue.

It's always important to look back and reflect on emotional events that take place to learn from them and improve for the next time - good or bad. We are all learning creatures, and we can always "self-upgrade". Personally, writing this post already helped me quite a bit. I hope this would help someone else reading it in the future.

I always dislike it when I read a post explaining why there's been a break in posting. It's usually a sign that the next post will be the last if it will happen at all, and it's always some excuse about being busy, life getting in the way, etc. etc. So I guess now it's my turn to write one of these posts.

I've been away for a week, traveling overseas to see family. The trip in itself was fine and not as eventful as I anticipated (which is a good thing). When I got back, I immediately bought two things: a HOTAS for Elite Dangerous, and a good headset with a DAC to experience music better. I am almost done writing a post about the later. 

My mornings, which were once completely empty and dedicated to writing, now share time with going to the gym. As it turns out, it's much easier to keep a gym routine in the morning. 

Emacs and Org mode - not much changed there, as a matter of fact. I tried the [[https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el][Gcal]] for Emacs and ended up disappointed after I figured out how to set it up. [[http://www.orgzly.com/][Orgzly]], on the other hand, keeps evolving and becomes a must-have tool for all org-mode users with Android devices in my opinion. 

So there's quite a bit to talk about and expand on. I hope to get back on track soon with a new post. In the meantime, feel free to say hello or read my older posts.
