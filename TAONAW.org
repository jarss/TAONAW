 I asked my coworkers the following question: 
 "What is the one truth, in a sentence, you've learned from being in a help desk position"? Here are the answers. 

 #+hugo: more

 *Chris (age:25, years in the job:3)*: "There are a lot, and I mean a /lot/, stupid people in the world." 

 *Nick (age:28, years in the job:10)*: "You got to have a lot of patience" 

 *Dave (age:63, years in the job:30)*: "You're only as good as the last person you've helped" 

 *Myself (years in the job:3)*: "If it was really to 'just work', we'd be out of a job"

 When looking at the nature of the job and the experience each one of us had, these facts make a lot of sense. 

 Chris is the youngest, very bright, and after money. He's tired of users forgetting to check the power cable or not knowing how to reset their computers before calling. Nick is a chill guy who never seems to get upset. He is used to the boss demanding things and he exercises every day, which definitely help to take out aggravations. Dave has seen it all in this job and been through a couple of management changes. His other favorite sentence is "tomorrow is another day."

Having a consisted, stable server for my org files has been on my mind for a while. I bought a Raspberry PI (RP) to serve as a file server to be used as a "hub" that will always be on and host these files. This is a description of the setup of what I've done to make this work. I hope you'd find this useful! Feel free to contact me with any questions. 

#+hugo: more

**** Buying the Raspberry Pi. 

 For the setup I describe here, you need the RP itself, a power source, an SD card, a USB case for 2.5 inch HDD, and the HDD itself. You'll also need an Ethernet cord for this setup. If you don't have one, go grab yourself a [[https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-RJ45-Cat-6-Ethernet-Patch-Cable-5-Feet-1-5-Meters/dp/B00N2VILDM/ref=lp_9938478011_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1542991619&sr=1-1][CAT6 cord Amazon Basics]] cable, it's always good to have one around.  

 For the RP, you better off getting a package similar to [[https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01C6Q2GSY/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1541986065&sr=1-2-fkmr0&keywords=canakit+raspberry+pi+3+b%252B+sd+card][this one]]. You could probably get something slightly cheaper by getting all the parts yourself, but not by much. Better to have everything you need at once without worrying about forgetting something. I didn't get the above package with the SD card, so I had to wait a couple of days for another order to come in. 

 The HDD I had laying around already, so I got [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M08LCXW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][this case]] for it. 8 bucks. 

**** Setting up the RP

 First, we're going to set up the SD card to run our RP. 

 Before we jump in, a note about my setup: I have Linux in a VM inside a Windows host. As it turns out, having Windows an alt-tab away (or in my case, ctrl+alt+left arrow away) can be very useful. 

 If switch between Windows programs and Linux commands without mentioning it, that's because this setup comes naturally to me at this point. I've been working this way (office and home) for almost four years, minusaa half a year of dual-booting with Linux-Mint as my daily OS. There's a whole story here about the switch to Linux and back, but that's for another time. 

 OK! Enough chatter. Let's get on with it.  

  1. Download [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/][Raspbian]] (zip file).
  2. Format the SD to FAT32
  3. Unzip, and write the image to the SD using [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/][Win32 diskimager]] or Underbootin. For me, the first option is better when I deal with SD cards and my USB-SD adapter, YMMV. 
  4. Create an empty file (no extension) on the SD root called SSH. 

 That last part is important. Creating the file (in windows, just create a new text file, rename to SSH and delete the extension) is what tells our RP to open port 22 for SSH.

 Then you insert the SD card and power the RP up. Log into your router to find the RP's IP address.  This is why you need to Ethernet connection for. You won't be able to access the RP with WiFi for this.

 Go ahead and SSH into the RP as pi: =ssh pi@[RP IP address here]=. your default password is raspberry. 

 Once in, you want to sudo into  RP config tool: =sudo raspi-config=. The setup tool is straightforward enough, but I found that remoting into the pi itself with VNC (coming up) is more convenient, so the only option we really care about now is to turn VNC on: 
 go to interface options (option 5 in my case, in the middle), and do that. 

 Save, get out, and then download [[https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/vnc/linux/][RealVNC]]. I downloaded it for Linux because that's what I use to SSH and setup my Pi. It's also where later I will setup Syncthing (coming up), so it made sense. RealVNC is the recommended option for RPs. it's easy to install and run, and supports VNCing with a password, which is what you need for the RP. As a bonus, it automatically creates nice thumbnails of the last logins (IP addresses) which can be useful.

 With RealVNC, go ahead and connect to the RP using the same IP address and default password. The Raspbian will jump on you right away telling you need to change your default password and a bunch of other things. and that's all good. Follow these screens, and after updates are downloaded, /don't/ restart just yet. 

 You might have noticed you're working in a tiny little screen. Let's change that quickly by going to the preferences (click on the RP icon at the top left), then Raspberry Pi Configurations. Under resolution, choose something that works well for you. for my ultra wide screen, 1920x1080 was good enough to work in. Now you can restart. If you changed your password (you should have!) leave RealVNC on and it will inform you the password is wrong (because you changed it). All good, log in. 

**** A note about passwords and password generators

If you use a password manager (my favorite on Linux now is xpass, LastPass is another), I strongly recommend to copy-paste your password in plaintext somewhere first, then copy it to the RP password-change field, and click the eye icon to reveal it. /Make sure what you pasted is the same thing you think you pasted/. In my case, I messed this up twice and had to image my SD card all over again. Yes, [[https://howtoraspberrypi.com/recover-password-raspberry-pi/][there's a technique to reset up the password by booting into the root shell]], but this didn't work for me. And besides, it's annoying and requires to physically connect a screen and keyboard to the RP. 

Because my RP is set up for SSH with a password for now, I made a random 32 character password for it. copy-paste is not a choice. 

**** Encrypting the HDD

I chose to use a separate HDD for a couple of reasons: 

1. I can take it with me if I need to and mount to another machine
2. I have unused HDDs laying around from computer repairs. In my case, the HDD is 500GB, more than enough for text files and occasional pictures I use in Org-mode.
3. If the HDD dies, I still have a functional RP with the OS on the SD card. 

The encryption tool of choice for me ended up being LUKS, the same thing that encrypts Linux machines at startup. Actually, my first choice was [[https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html][VeryCrypt]]. It comes with a convenient GUI and better options to handle containers. As it turns out, there's no updated version for ARM (which is what the RP is), and I'd have to compile from source. Possible, but not worth it for now.

VNC into your RP.

1. First, Install cryptsetup on the RP (apt-get). This is the LUKS suite.
2. Figure out the USB-connected drive: =sudo fdisk -l=. this will show you where's your hdd in /dev. In my case, it was in /dev/sda (not sda1, etc.) 
3. Format with LUKS:  =cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/[drive]= the default option was fine for me, but be aware that LUKS comes with many options if you so desire. When formatting, it should ask for a passphrase, so give it one. Then it should start doing its thing.
4. When done, verify your drive is encrypted with  =cryptsetup luksDump /dev/[drive]=. You should see information about the encryption, along with the first key (LUKS can hold up to eight keys) and its hash. This means we're all good so far. 
5. Now, create a mount point for your drive. for me, out of habit of using Mint, that was /media/pimount. So: =sudo mkdir /media/pimount=. 
6. This is where things get a bit hazy since I'm writing this from memory. We need to open the encrypted drive with =cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mapper/[drive name] [mounting point name]=. Notice we have *mapper* in the path after dev now. that's how LUKS work. The encryption is not being done on /dev/[drive] itself. I'm not sure why (I'm sure there's some Linux file system reason behind it), so feel free to educate me.
7. Now, we need to format the drive with the file system of our choice. In my case, ext4. I believe this can also be done for FAT32 or even NTFS if you want to access your drive from Windows, but I haven't tested that. To format, you can download Gparted, which is good to have in general. However, this is easy to do with =mkfs.ext4 /dev/[name]=. In fact, that's exactly what Gparted would do for you anyway.
8. Mount the freshly formatted drive: =mount /dev/mapper/[name] /media/[name]=  If we have "show mounted drives" option on the desktop in RP, it should show now. As a matter of fact, it's a good idea to enable this (right click on the RP desktop). 

Before you start putting stuff on your HDD, it's a good idea to restart and practice mounting the drive again (step 6 and 8; you don't need to format again!). Then do it again. The unmount command is umount (no n), or you can simply restart the Pi.  There's a way to automate this using fstab, but messing your fstab could screw up your RP as it happened to me. I figured I never plan on really turning off the thing, so I will just keep doing it manually. Now, if someone happens to just grab your HDD and walk away, it will need to be mounter and decrypted. 

**** Syncthing setup

To me, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncthing][Syncthing]] is the best solution for all my file-syncing needs. It works without a hitch until you need to change something tiny and meaningless. Then all hell breaks loose. I don't understand why that is, but I learned to accept it as a fact of life at this point. 

During this RP weekend setup, I had to change my Syncthing setup so that the RP will become the central hub. What happened was a fruitless night of trying to figure out why Syncthing stopped syncing and  an messy Monday at work. It was such a bad setback, in fact, that I decided to create a process dubbed "downfall" for future cases just like this one when I can't use Org-mode at work. Yes, not having Syncthing basically means I can't use Org. But I digress... The important lesson here is this: 

don't mess with Syncthing. Set it up, make sure it works, and /don't touch it/. 

As intimidating as this sounds, Syncthing actually has a pretty simple setup process. Here's the plan: 

[[file:static/hub.png]]

The different colors represent the different folders in syncthing. To me these are personal, work, utilities (this is the only folder that does not have org files), and archive. 

I use four devices, three daily, one (laptop) once in a while. The home VM, which is my main productivity box, gets everything. So does the laptop, it's meant to be used as my home away from home. My work VM (OpenSuse Linux) only contains work org files and the archive. On the phone, I skip media-heavy folders like DnD and some classical music flac files to save space. 

The setup process:

1. Install Syncthing on RP (apt-get). 
2. Choose the first device to sync. Add the RP's ID to its Syncthing.
3. /Wait/ for RP to acknowledge the device. Approve.
4. From the connecting device, share the folders you want to sync with the RP.
5. /Wait/ for RP to acknowledge folders. Approve each, choose path.
6. Verify the sync work by altering the files a bit.
7. Choose the second device to sync... repeat step 3-5.

Now, folders that common to a couple of devices should be added first from one device (as stated above) with the RP, and then add that folder to the /other/ device. Device_A --> RP --> Device_B. This ensures you're sharing the same folder (same folder ID) and not creating duplicates. The reason you're doing it this way and not just sharing from one device to another is because you don't want the other devices to see each other; they should only "see" the RP. The RP is the only device that needs to see all of them. Fewer complications means Syncthing works better and faster. Remember what I said earlier: don't play with it, keep it simple and it will work. Complicate it, and you'll spend hours trying to figure out what's wrong.  

So for example, if I first sync my home VM and share the "work" folder to the RP, after I'm done and verify the sync work, I am connecting the work VM to the RP, wait until it's recognized, and then send the work folder (which is now synced between home VM and RP) /to/ the work VM.

    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: macOS Secure Token Trouble
    :EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2018-11-26:
    :END:

Most chances are, you won't even hear about Secure Token unless you happen to manage Macs for your company. Secure Token seems to be only an issue with Active Directory.

#+hugo:more

Because Apple doesn't talk much about Secure Token, I suggest you read about it on [[https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/secure-token-and-filevault-on-apple-file-system/][Der Flounder]]. There's a pretty good explanation of what it does and why. 

My story begins with the delivery of an iMac. It usually takes me 1.5 hours to prep a Mac from start to finish since we don't have a working image yet; that's a whole issue in itself. The prepped iMac gets to the user bound to the domain so all they have to do is log in. I then connect them to their user's share drive (as a startup item so they always have it) and see if they need access to any printers that we don't have on the server, There is usually at least one. 

I have to log in first (as the iMac's admin) to unlock FileVault. So far, so good. Then, using the fast switching menu, I get back to the login screen and ask the user to log in using their domain credentials. On AFPS, like the one here, I get the Security Token window. Mo problem. I put in the admin credentials, the user is approved, and after adding said printers and share drive, we restart to make sure everything is in working order. 

Last week though, it didn't. 

The user that I just authenticated was not on the login screen. My admin account was there, my test account was there, his account... nope. This was odd since I knew we just went through authenticated with the secure token. I logged into my admin account and check the security settings since I know it will tell me if anyone is not allowed to log in because of FileVault... but nothing. I ran =fdesetup list=, which shows the list of approved FileVault users, and sure enough, he was there. 

In the next couple of days, I've had a couple of users log into this iMac to test. I also had the user log into a different iMac, one that I set up a week previously using the exact same procedure. Everyone could sign in and /stay/ approved (they'd show up after approved with the secure token and restart) on the iMac besides this one person. On the other iMac, we ran into the same issue with this user. The problem then was with the account. 

Because I saw the user log in and out so many times and checked the users list, I noticed something odd: the user's name was omitted. There was nothing at the top right corner (fast switching) and in the list of users, the icon for a user showed up without a name. I've never seen anything like that before on a mac.

Back at my desk I looked into the account and couldn't find anything odd at first. I even copied the account to create another test user... and then I saw it: the Display Name field for that user was blank for some reason. The Display Name field in AD is populated automatically when a new user is created, but not here. 

Today I managed to do final testing. I repeated the same test: signed in with admin, gave my test user with the blank Display Name field access with secure token, and restarted. Sure enough, the test user could not be seen on the login screen. Only after my admin account was signed in the test user was able to sign in as well. 

As soon as I populated the Display Name field and logged in again, everything worked. The name showed up, and the secure token remained. 

The conclusion: macOS pulls the user's name field from "Display Name" in AD. And it /needs/ this name for the secure token. Without it, it doesn't work. the secure token is tied to the display name of the user, not the user account itself... or at least, not completely.

When someone asks what we install on their personal devices (BYOD laptops), I usually give them the abridged version. People rarely care about details. Every now and then though, someone is a bit concerned and asks for more information. Stuff like why do we need software that tells us details about their hardware, how do we use it, and of course, if we can view their personal data. My answer to that last question is "we can if we want to." It bothers me this question comes only from so few individuals.

#+hugo:more

A few days ago, A client gave me her under-performing BYOD laptop for general cleanup before switching it back for strictly personal use. She knew about the different bits of software we install because she asked me when she first brought it in. She was curious and worried about her privacy and she got the full story from me. I have no doubt that the conversation was motivating enough for her to come back for a cleanup -- and for the right reasons. I dare hope that she sought me out specifically to clean her laptop because she trusted me a bit more after that conversation.  

How many people leave us with their personal laptop without ever bothering checking in with us to make sure our software is removed? A few of them will take the time to wipe their laptops, but so many more, the majority for sure, will never bother.  

Among our most intrusive software is an Anti Virus client that dials home to our management environment and an inventory management software that gives us full details about the hardware and software installed on the device. We also effectively have root privileges on BYOD devices, basically a backdoor on their system.  

There's nothing unique about what we do. The same practices are followed by virtually every respectful IT company that deals with BYODs. Nothing we do have sinister intentions, and I trust everyone on my team not to abuse root privileges on BYOD devices which are often one of the most personal things a person owns. But that doesn't mean our clients should just trust us blindly.

 According to my notes, I started using Org seriously mid August of this years. I was thinking it will be interesting to see what I learned and where I am today. 

**** Beginnings: costumizing Org and journaling

 At the beginning, my main concerns were regarding wokring with Org the way I used to previously, and journaling. Before using Org and Emacs, I used [[https://typora.io/][Typora]], which I still think is one of the best tools I've seen to writing Markdown. It was a minimalist and pretty application which I enjoyed writing my journal notes in. I tried to copy this experience into Emacs, but of course, Org comes with many organizational options Typora is not desgined to  have. 

 It took some time to get used to letting Org dealing with dates and then eventually shift to its date format (I used to write dates and times without hyphens, like 20180101:1521). I then took a nautral turn to start my transformation into a weekly mindset with org. I always prefered to work in a weekly mindset and journaled about my week going back, but now I also started to organized my todos this way and slowly started counting on my Aenda rather then just an org file for work and for personal life. This is how I stayed until today. 

**** Improving Technical Skills

Using Emacs meant looking into some techical elements that I was familair yet not comfortable with. To make Emacs mine, I had to dig deeper into its init file, learn to use org-capture, set up and use my computer as SSH server for TRAMP, and eventually, create a VM at work. All the above skills were needed to make Org mode useful for me at work, which I knew from the beginning would be the big test. 

***** Init into Org: 

The Emacs init file still looks somewhat alien and hostile to me without comments explaining what exactly each snippet of code does. Only when I shifted to Org, a task which took at least two weekends, I started being more comfortable with changing parts of my settings for different computers. This, in turn, is what allowed me to work on Emacs from a dedicated VM at work. 

Different things in my org  settings, such as the capture templates, are revisted for minior tweaks with relative ease which was not possible within the inital init file for me. I had to explain terms in my own way, not the Emacs way, to really "get it".

**** Going down from 50 to 20 tickets

It was a Wednesday, and I was wondering how I cut down about half of my tickets in two days. The week started out with abotu 50 tickets, and I was now looking at 26 that were still active. Even though usually I hope to leave my desk for the weekend with no more than 20 active tickets, the most that would show on one page without clicking "next", this was definitely progress in the right direction.   

**** What helped, and why

There were a couple of helpful factors since Monday that I wanted to note for myself. 

First, management hired a temp who worked with us before. The guy was not only fast and hard-working, he also had a general understanding of our environment. It wasn't his knowledge that helped the most (though, it definitely came in handy), but the fact that he served as a "buffer" between us and the "fires" managment and customers had us take over. We all have rules we learn through our jobs, and in my case the rule is "it's never as simple as at looks." Basically, it means that if I'm dragged out of my dask for some rudimentary task, I'm going to spend 90% of the time getting to the root of the problem and 10% to fix the issue itself. 

Second, also thanks to the temp, I had someone to send to "probe" an existing task. It is often the case that a customer doesn't respond back, either allowing us to close the task as complete or get back to us with more necessary details, like you know, which computer out of our fleet has an issue. That alone allowed me to close around 10 tasks that were duplicates of others or were just hanging in the air with a question mark. 

Third, bigger boss was out, which means less pressure or boss to give side tasks. With no new projects, I was able to focus on my present issues dig out many stale incidents. 

Fourth, my other co-worker who had the second biggest queue was back in office and able to attend to tickets. This usually doesn't affect me as much because I don't cover his cases (unless its an emergency), but then again, it does. 

Fifth, Org-mode was working beatifully after my [[https://joshrollinswrites.com/techden/raspberry_pi_org_hub/][Pi setup]]. Everything I changed on my work VM synced beatifully to my home VM without issues, and my personal files (which include my wiki and journal, both of which I use at work) where accessible even though my home desktop was behind a VPN that blocks SSH. That's because my Pi is the only device now accessible to the outside world.  

**** How does Org help (mgt doesn't get it)

Org mode has long become my pillar of stability in an highly hectic environment. This is a repeated theme in this blog, I realize. This week is yet another fine example of working by my own order of things. With Org, I have an agenda that goes from hour to hour, from day to day. I know what ticket I need to look at before lunch, which incident needs a review before I leave for the day. I have titles that make sense to me the next day when I come in, and details that tell me exactly where I left off and what I should do next. With org, I have both personal and work related issue written down with me wherever I go, so my priorites are really /my/ priorities. 

I often think that a good manager should know how to align work priorties with that of his workers, not /force/ them. An excellent manager should be able to help train his workers to work like soliders in the battlefield. Each solider is obident and works according to instructions, but at the same time, can function completely independently if needs be. It's the opposite of micromanagment which freezes employees in their track without managment intevention and oftne give up and go home. 

This last part if what org is to me. It is my personal order of functions and my how-tos. At first glance, it looks like I'm giving myself extra work by copying every active issue over to this seemingly archaic text-only system. The truth is of course, that once it's in my system, I can follow through with it to completion with all the information I need available to me at all times, even after work hours. That, in my opinion, what makes me more productive than a mindless drone.

It’s been a while since I blogged about my Org activities. Overall, not a lot has changed from my latest setup. Setting up a new site on GitHub with Hugo kept me fairly busy, away from hacking away at Emacs.

**** Lighter Agenda: No Sub-Tasks

So, looking at my agenda sometimes less is more. I don’t rush to include every single detail in my agenda anymore, especially at work, becuase it’s redundant. We have a ticketing system that we /have/ to use, and the details are constantly updated by different team members. Because of that, updating technical details for myself again under each heading is not that appealing.

But I do still include notes. Just differently. I start notes with an inactive timestamp and describe where I left off. In other words, exactly what the subtask used to do. So I don’t bother with many sub-tasks anymore. The benefit of one heading is better visual organization. I get a nice Logbook which includes all the time I spent on the project, my notes are more streamlined and easy to find. It also clears the agenda from the clutter of subtasks that sometimes don’t make sense to me anymore because I forgot the big picture already. I also grew more comfortable with changing the header wordings of the task to better reflect what is the big picture I just mentioned. Since I keep short notes of where I left off with the most recent one at the top, it’s easy to see what’s going on.

[[file:static/OrgUpdate_2.png]]

Sometimes I would even copy-paste from the ticket straight into Org just to remind myself what was done; other times I include references to other people and cases; yet other times, if I have to vent about something, there’s a link to my journal (more on that later).

A fun sidenote: Orgzly, my companion Andoird App, [[http://www.orgzly.com/changelog][now has the ability]] to start with Org headings collapsed. This means that when I’m on the go, I can open specifically the task on hand and view my notes which I often update just before I get up to do something.

A little test here. And here.

**** Keeping Track Of Time Without Going Nuts

The Logbook contains estimated times. I almost never get to close a clock on a task once I started, because I almost never get the chance to keep working on one thing before I am called away, or have to do a prerequisite. Other times, I simply forget to start the clock. I estimate how much time I worked on something when I’m back at my desk. Now, since I don’t bother with sub-tasks and separate clocking times for these, it means I need to expend my agenda to view my logs (l in agenda view). This allows me to see the time I spent working on a certain task, even though it is marked as done later, sometimes even days (or weeks) later. This way I know when the whole task was finished, and I can see when (and for how long) I was working on it.

All of that said, most of my tasks don't get logged with a clock. That’s because many of them are simple tasks or just interruptions when I am asked a question or something similar. I should overall though get in the habit of logging tasks in retro-respect to see where my time went.

Another area I stopped worrying as much about are which org files in my archive my headers go to when I refile. This was a mouthful so let me explain.

My system is based on a weekly review. Every week has its own .org file. In the past, filenames used to specify a date range like =08102018_15102018.org=, for example. This caused me complications because I seldom had the chance to summarize and finish my week Sunday and start a clean slate Monday. Many times I wanted to conclude an .org file on a Friday after work or didn’t get the chance to do so until Monday or even Tuesday. Besides, this whole week range thing is redundant because you can always list files by dates anyway (to see when it was last modified).

On the other hand, since I started using my journal again, which is based on weeks rather than months, it made more sense to name the files after the number of the weeks. For instance, this week is w41.org, last week was w40.org, etc. My journal tells me what week I’m on if I ever need to reflect, the file name is very clear and obvious and there’s no room for confusion. My weekly summaries will always be based on their respective =<number>.org=, even if I summarize a month later.

In the past, I refiled events and tasks depending on what week they were to take place. If I was planning a vacation four weeks in advance, for example, I would open a new file for that week and place the event there. This lead to all kinds of problems when I worked on projects that stretched over more than just a weekly period. Let’s say I take a vacation from Friday to Monday of next week. Now what, which file do I choose? At the time, I opted for the completion date. But, this too wasn’t simple. Because certain projects (especially at work) could last even months, or re-surface from the past. That would mean I would have to move them to the appropriate week and think about what “done” really means. One day thinking about it out loud, I just started laughing at myself: “dude,” I said, as I like to refer anyone for some reason, “what are you doing? Org takes care of all of that for you automatically! That’s what’s the Agenda is for!” Who cares if I placed a project in week 20 or week 30, I don’t ever search it that way or know where it comes from anyway, I just see it on the agenda or search for it with the agenda anyway =(C-a s)=. That’s what it’s for. So I stopped caring about that, and events now naturally fall into the week I created them.

**** The Journal Revisited

I don’t use the journal as much as I used to when I had it earlier this year. I find that I use it capture experiences and emotions more than technical notes. For the later, I now have an org file called “wiki” which I keep organized as it grows further. The journal is good to keep moods and mental “patterns” I can look into on my weekly review. For this, I also use tags. This is a good exercise that allows me to recognize mental “traps” I get into more often than not.

The journal works nicely with my weekly reviews, which are essentially weekly videos I make reading back from my agenda and journal. With time, these became more of a personal “summary of summaries” where I highlight my week tasks and review, usually for a 10-minute segment or so. I keep these in a well-compressed mp4 format on an SD card ([[https://ffmpeg.org/][FFMPEG]] is awesome for that) and I can easily use one SSD for an entire year and still have additional room. I am now starting to name the videos based on the same weekly theme that I use for my weekly agenda files and journal.

Over time, my videos definitely got smaller. This is because I got used to Org in different areas of recording my thoughts. I [[https://jarss.github.io/TAONAW/blog/org-update/][discussed these]] couple of times before: tasks, task notes, and journal.

#+hugo: more

My tasks do rarely contain sub-tasks anymore. This is odd because sub-tasking was one of the reasons that got me into Org-mode initially. Over time I found that I rather leave notes to myself about where I left off and what needs to be done instead of using actual tasks.

Task notes are usually brief (one paragraph with 3 to 5 lines) and are always timestamped with most recent on top. This quickly lets me know where I stopped a task and why. Interestingly, I use it also to indicate general mundane errands, like grocery shopping. In such cases, I can also include a checklist. 

The journal is a different story. This is where I let myself spill the beans. I took a long break from using a journal because I felt there's so much recording done on a keyboard, and I wanted a quicker way to record my thoughts.

But recording my thoughts was inconvenient. I had to take a break from my workflow, record a video, name it, compress it, and save it. It required that I'll find a quiet corner - nearly impossible to do during my day - to record for a few minutes. So out of necessity, I started to include more text in my task notes. Eventually, I felt they become too long, too personal, and just too heavy. I needed a separation and going back to my journal felt natural. 

I find that typing is just slow enough to make me process what I'm thinking. I can edit what I'm trying to say, which means I can rethink of a better way of describing it. To prevent myself from going on and on, I journal on specific events only, never an entire day. My capture template takes the link of my event and makes it the title, and then continue to discuss only that event. 

Yesterday, I noticed something interesting: with time, my rambling on videos was reduced from going on an on for an hour plus or so (and multiple videos) to shorter segments. Here's a visual: 

[[file:static/videojournalevolved_1.png]]

/Above: over time, my clips become shorter/ 

Finally, last weekend, I reached the conclusion that my written journal is just /better/ at keeping track of my experiences. Since I re-created the way I save my achieve files now, it also means the links from the journal org file to the org and the events is never broken: I just have to make sure to refile an event from my "oh snap" thought-dump org into the current week org file, and I'm good. 

I still record a short "weekly summary" on weekends, and now I find I'm actually looking forward to it. These are now 10-20 minutes long videos in which I briefly go through my agenda and logged events and explain what happened while my memories of this week are still fresh. I then give the week a "theme". 

This works as a way for me to remember what happened far in the future if I want to reflect on my experiences but not looking for something specific, or not sure what it is. It's also a good way to reflect on the major events of the week after I had a weekend to slow down and process. It works.

    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Emacs Windows Managment
    :END:

In his 5th Emacs podcast, [[https://emacscast.org/episode_5/][Rakhim]] discusses the difficulties of windows management in Emacs. I agree with him. Emacs' Windows are a pain. It was probably one of the longest pet peeves I had with the program, and it wasn't until this podcast that I realized that I'm much better off than I used to be. 

#+hugo: more

I don't use any extension that manages windows (unless you consider Ivy's switch buffer, which he uses too. [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is awesome). My method is based on bits and pieces I picked up. Here are a couple of lines from my settings.org, which I use to make Emacs' windows work better for me. 

First, for my ultra-wide screen at home, it helps to enlarge the default frame size. After a few tests, I found this size satisfying: 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(setq default-frame-alist '((width . 90) (height . 50) (menu-bar-lines . 6)))
#+END_SRC

Then, we need to turn on the mouse vertical mouse divider. This will allow us to use the mouse to drag and adjust windows in our frame vertically as well. I actually don't use this as much anymore (the reason is coming up) but this is a basic feature that should be on by default, in my opinion: 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(window-divider-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

Another basic feature, which I now use everywhere, is the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Visual-Line-Mode.html][visual line mode]]. If you write more than you code on Emacs (which is true in my case) this mode just makes sense. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-visual-line-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

Those are all good and nice, but here's the biggest tip which I stumbled upon a few months back, from [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_effective_windows_management.html][Ergoemacs]]: just don't use windows. Use frames. Seriously, it's that simple. There are probably many Emacs experts out there with their windows functions and extensions and what not, but let's not reinvent the wheel here. If there's one thing a GUI is good for is to manage windows (or frames in Emacs). They are very easy to move with the mouse, they snap to each other, easy to resize. Besides, Emacs itself splits the frames to Windows often enough. I find that I use C-0 and C-1 very often to get rid of windows I don't need, and I can have them back quickly by switching back to the buffer with Ivy.

One of the things that used to drive my bananas when I started using Org was how the agenda and its habit to kill my windows setup. One of the most helpful lines in my settings.org is the following: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-window-setup (quote other-frame))
#+END_SRC

This saved me from going insane. Since I start up my agenda every time I start up my Emacs, this shortcut also effectively creates the other frame for me to work with until I exit Emacs. From there, I can just use the Agenda frame itself to switch to another buffer if I want to. Agenda is also the only place where I do use windows often - when I tab into one of my headers there. I tab into a task, view it, make changes if I want, save, and C-0 to return to full agenda view. It's so fast it's just my muscle memory now.

[[https://mastodon.social/@emsenn][emsenn]] [[https://mastodon.social/@emsenn/101387457090836368][asked]] Org-mode users for their day-to-day capture templates in the [[https://mastodon.technology][technology Mastodon]] (which you should join and follow if you haven't yet). I was happy to reply and figured it would be intesting to dig into my capture templates. I started writing this post explaining all of my templates, but then realized I'm starting to edit out details because the post is getting too long. So instead, I'm going to explain each template at a time. Hopefully you find this interesting!  

#+hugo: more

First, Here's the code for the capture templates I'm going to cover:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
        ("i" "INC" entry (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Incidents")
        "** TODO %? \n  %^{Ticket}p %^{PIN}p %^{Computer}p %^{Location}p \n")
        ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/Documents/Personal/journal.org")
        "**** %U%?%a \n" :tree-type week)
        ("t" "ToDo" entry (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Tasks")
        "** TODO %? \n SCHEDULED: %^T \n")
        ("e" "Event" entry (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Event")
        "** %? \n %^T \n")
#+END_SRC

Going into details below, I broke the code down so it makes sense to people starting out with Org-mode in hope this would help new-commers like I was not too long ago. If these steps do not sound right (especially for those of you who know Emacs lisp better than me, which is probably 99% of you...) please let me know so I can correct and learn. Thanks! 

Ok, here we go.  

**** Part 1 - The INC Template 
1
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
("i" "INC" entry 
  (file+headline "~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org" "Incidents")

"** TODO %? \n  
  %^{Ticket}p %^{PIN}p %^{Computer}p %^{Location}p \n
")
#+END_SRC

1. For key-press "i" initiate "INC" template as follows: 
2. Create a headline "Incidents" in file  =~/Documents/Archive/#OhSnap!.org=...
3. ...As a second level header. Create a TODO keyword, space, place cursor here, new line.
6. Create Property "Ticket" and ask for input.
7. Create Property "PIN" and ask for input
8. Create Property "Computer" and ask for input
9. Create Property "Location" and ask for input
10. Space, New line
11. Finish


I use the above template for ticket creation at work. The file "OhSnap.org" is my "dumping grounds" for everything before I sort it out- usually in front of a desktop. This is useful to me because many times I'm running around using my phone with [[http://www.orgzly.com][Orgzly]], a very minimal version of Org-mode. I click the add note widget, speak or write out my note in a few words, and save. Later I add details. (By the way, going on a tangent here: you can use Google Assistant on your phone with Orgzly like any other note taking app: "OK Google, make note: buy eggs today" - and bam, you have a quick header in your org file.)

The properties help me keep my work-related issues organized. I have the ticket number for the issue, which is also the fastest way to find it in our ticketing system. Then I have the person's ID, to quickly identify the person's name and email from the directory if I need to. The computer property is the hostname, so I can remote in or know where it is. Location is helpful because we span over different buildings and even parts of the city. In turn, this also makes Column view beneficial if I want to quickly see all the tickets formatted in a nice table. I don't use it often, but it's there.  

I don't always have all the properties filled in (though I do try to at least have a ticket and a person's name entered), but I do use this template for anything work related. This is because I have a "work" category property inside the Incident tree, which quickly shows me my work related things on my agenda. This means I can also quickly filter into just work-related stuff if I need to, say, when I show something to my co-workers. 

Let me expand on that last at the risk of going into a somewhat unrelated tangent: one of the huge things about Org-mode efficiency in my case is the ability to mix work and personal items in the same place. I have different apps, difference accounts, and different devices, and Org-mode is the first place where I'm comfortable mixing all of them into one agenda because I still have individual org files. This /very/ helpful to keep me organized. 

This concludes part 1. As you can see I went into other areas that are not directly related to the template itself. Let me know what you think, and if you want me to expand further! Thanks for reading.

I was happy to see part one of this series generated interest on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/agxe8n/my_orgmode_templates_part_one_any_interest_in_more/][Reddit]]. One of the things I love about Org-mode (and Emacs) is this passion among its user and the thirst to learn more from each other. I believe one of the major reasons for that is Org-mode's complexity: there are so many options, it /has/ to be personalized by its users' needs. Org-mode is esaily the most personal tool I've used in a while. Every time I read something Org-mode related somewhere else it's as if I'm invited over for a discussion over a cup of coffee. 

#+hugo: more

Speaking of personal, today I'm going to discuss my Journal capture template. I hope you enjoy, and as always, comments are welcome on Reddit (follow me using the links above) at least until I integrate a commenting system on this site.

**** Part 2 - The Journal template

First, here's the code: 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
("j" "Journal" entry 
  (file+datetree "~/Documents/Personal/journal.org")
  
  "**** %U%?%a \n" :tree-type week)
#+end_src

1. For key-press "j" initiate "Journal" template, which as follows:
2. Go to =~/Documents/Personal/journal.org= and create a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html#DOCF82][dateree]] entry there
3. Create a sub header (level 4) under the day header, under the week header, under the year header (a function of datetree, see link above). 
4. Enter an inactive timestamp, place cursor right after it, place a link to file you were just in.
5. New line
6. Make this a /weekly/ datetree (the default is a monthly datetree)
7. Finish

I prefer a weekly format in my journal over a monthly format. In fact, the week is a "productivity unit" which always made sense to me, and this mindset integrates beautifully into Org-mode. In my archive folder, which you saw in part 1, each week has its own =.org= file (from 1 to 50 something). I don't really need this to make Org-mode work, but there's something assuring in viewing the folder and seeing all the week files.

The reason the timestamp and the link are condensed together (no space) is because I delete most of the timestamp and just leave the hour. This way the cursor is where I need to start erasing the timestamp from. I haven't found a way yet to create an hourly timestamp only and I don't want to forget to put in the hour, so this is the best solution for now. Why is the hour important? First, personal preference from the past, where I would write the time and the location for each entry. Second, this helps me see a couple of entries in the journal that are about the same event (the title is just the name of the event on my agenda) so that if a certain event is developing and I've journaled about it a couple of times, I can easily see the hour of each entry as a separator. 

Finally, I use a link to connect me back to =w[##].org= file (week number of the year, as I mentioned above) from which I created the journal entry. In my weekly org files, the incidents or events themselves contain very little details, usually only what is my next action (next thing to do) and a logbook drawer containing the times I worked on a task if I keep track. If I want to discuss something, I create a journal entry for it. I always prefer to leave my thoughts and conclusions in a personal space, separate from the more generic org file which also contains work-related material. The link takes me back to that event or incident, and because the name is the same as the event, I know exactly what I'm referring to. 

[[file:static/Org-capture-template-2.1.png]]

My journal is another feature of Org-mode that fits my workflow effortlessly. The notion that I keep entries around events rather than just a daily or a semi-daily habit works well and behooves me to write my thoughts down often. At the same time, the journal file is kept in a personal folder that is not synced to my work VM. I use TRAMP inside my work VM's capture template, so when I want to capture something in my journal from work, I'm prompted to log into my file server with a password, without saving anything at work. 

This privacy barrier may sound cumbersome, but once working, I almost never have to tweak with it. This kind of privacy and separation of my personal files from the cloud help me sleep better at night.

 )
#+end_src

1. For key-press "t" initiate "ToDo" template as follows:
2. Create a headline "tasks" in file =~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org=
3. Add a TODO keyword as a second level header. Place curosr here. New line.
4. Add the word "=SCHEDULED:=", space, and add prompt for a complete timestamp (with time)
5. New line
6. Finish

To create a regular "todo" item, I want to have it scheduled right away so it's on my agenda. The addition of the word =SCHEDULED:= is what initiates the scheduling. I only do scheduled tasks, and I try to schedule everything I want to do. Things often get shifted around, but when they do the scheduling time changes and they remain on my agenda. That's all there is to this template, it's rather simple.

 )
#+end_src

1. For key-press "e" initiate "event" template as follows:
2. Create a headline "Event" in file ="~/Documents/Archive/OhSnap!.org"=
3. As a second level header. Place curosr here. New line.
4. Prompt for a complete timestamp. New line.
5. Finish

Even simpler than the previous tmeplate, this one asks for a timestamp completed with a time. The active timestamp alone means that this event will simple show on my agenda. I use these "concrete" events for meeting with other people or something that is happening to other people in my life that is important to me. 

I usually follow the event title with a @ sign and a link to the Google maps as to where it takes place if I can. This creates a nice way for me to reflect back later in my journal, which I mentioned earlier linsk to these events. For example, an event could be "=<2019-01-13 Sun 19:00-21:00> dinner with Marcy @ The Green Inn=" and The Green Inn would be a link to the location. 

Later, I will place the cursor on this event in my agenda and initiate the journal capture template, which will link to this even.

If you've bseen following me online for the last month or so (especially on reddit) you'd know I've been engaged in shifting away from WordPress and into the world [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]. 

#+hugo: more 

I'd imagine the people of in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/][r/emacs]] would raise an eyebrow at the term "world of Hugo." After all, Hugo is a relatively simple program, not a deep rabbit-hole like Emacs. Yet, it's Hugo that got me overwhelemed, not so much Emacs. What? Really? 

 You see, it has to do with background and expectations. As a non-programmer (as in, someone who never wrote anything a bit more complicated then a few lines of shell script) Emacs was a mountain. Standing at the bottom, I gazed at the cloud shrowing its peek and told myself "well, you gotta take a first step somewhere..." so I did. For me, that was Org-mode. As a matter of fact, at the time, I didn't even know much about Emacs and how deep it can get. All I knew was that Org was cool, and I'm interested in learning more.

 After a couple of months, I got a bit more comfortable with Emacs and my level of doing things with it. I am still miles away from the top, and I'm fine with that. I got Emacs to do most of what I want it to do for me at this point, which is writing these posts, my journal entries, and of course my agenda and tasks both at work and at home. 

 Hugo, on the other hand, was meant to replace WordPress. As a person who used WordPress on and off a couple of years, I expected more or less the same thing. You know, going to my webiste online somewhere, log in with a username and password, navigate the GUI and post stuff, add plugins... As such, I didn't care for a change that much. WordPress was working more or less OK, so why change to something similar and learn things all over again? 

 I get frequent alerts that my website is down from my webhost, but I got used to shrug these off. I got it as a cheap deal, and for about $6 a month or so hosting, what do you expect? People in the Emacs reddit mentioned they see more spam from my site's URL instead of my posts, but again, with 1 person complaining out of 10 or so, it wasn't a big deal. After all, SSL and https is for professional website that can afford it, and I am just an amatuer-ish blogger. Perhaps the biggest hurdle was Github: I knew people who use Hugo usually use Github to publish their blog, but they were all programmers. Me, I didn't know anything about Github or git. That was for coders, people who write scripts for a living. This is not me. I am not a porgrammer. 

 To be honest, I'm not sure what changed that perspective. Perhaps it was a random tutorial I saw about Git which made me realize it's not /that/ crazy complicated. Perhaps it was the fact that someone advised me not to link to my website again if I don't have https. Maybe it was just my inner geek, itching for a change, and WordPress was getting too familiar and too boring. Whatever it was, I took the bait, and I started doing all of it at once. 

 First I watched some Lynda videos about git and read a few posts. Then, I learned more about Hugo. After that, it was [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]]'s turn (because I gotta write my posts from inside Emacs), and then it was [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] (because I gotta use git from inside Emacs). I think I went through everything in a matter of about a month. I learned too much too fast. But that's how I roll. I don't know why I do that to myself, and I'm not sure how it makes sense to go from "git is for coders" to "ALL THE THINGS," but I do anyway. 

 Obviously, this attitude has terrible consequences. You learn everything on a very shallow level, which means the first tiny bump in the road sends you launching out of control. You get frustrated and you try again, just to hit another bump. Turns out, if I /learn everything/ I also expect to /know everything/ out of myself, which is of course nonsense. But not everything is futile. Knowing the big picture in advance is not a bad idea. Learning a couple of things at once make you realize how they work together, and helps you develop a mindset that is more skilled at solving specific problems. Later, when you go look at the official documents, certain things already make sense to you even though you haven't seen them before. 

 Be it as it may, it's not easy. I wouldn't recommend this method to anyone. it's doing damage control instead of learning. However, manuals never made sese to me. In the rare occessions where I do have the patience to read through the introduction, I'd forget what I wanted to do (or how to do it) by the time I get the real stuff. Besides, manuals are usually written by the people who made the program; as such, they are written from the inside, for insiders. Certain terms and syntax make aboslutely no sense to newcomers, who find that they struggle with basic terms that the veterans spit out as if they were born into it. Indeed, if there's one thing that I kept running into when learning Emacs is /not/ to bother with its documentation. As helpful as it is, and as much as everyone loves to say all the help you ever want is C-h v (or a or whatever) away, it was not true for me. It is much, much easier to Google something up and find a blog post (or a YouTube video) that explains it to you in plain English.

Now I'm much further ahead than where I was when I started my Hugo ordeal. I have sucessfully launched a couple of testing websites on and off Github. I have whined, complained, and whined again to anyone who would listen.


So, here we are with Hugo. I use git, and well, the site is on Github. This post was written with ox-hugo. I used Magit, but because there are so many issues I'm running into, I decided to make a decision not to use it for at least another month. It's very hard to hold myself back, for sure. On one hand, since I've done WordPress for so long, I'm aching to go back to my old website where I don't have problems learning how to create a new static page (that doesn't show on the front page of this blog), or how exactly images work with these posts, or how can I automate the long process of saving a post and updating my Hugo website compared to the simple "click to publish"  in WordPress. I'm sure some of you are aching to tell me just how to do some of these things. Don't worry, I'll get back to you.  

Oh, and speaking of helpful people: a big thank you to [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi][Kaushal Modi]], who kept answering my endless questions, who was there through my frustration, anywhere I went. This guy is passionate and compassionate about what he does.

PayPal informed me that the host of my WordPress blog is charging me for another $80 or so for the next year. The very next day, tumblr [[https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231885248-Sensitive-content][decided to shoot itself in the head]] (rather than the leg, if you ask me). It was good to be reminded to not trust cloud services for creative content - like my blog. 

 #+hugo: more

**** The Issues With my Host

My current host sucks. My WordPress blog continuously goes offline, so much so that I had to mute the alerts I got because they overwhelmed my inbox. My connection issues never got resolved. 

Another major issue with that website was the lack of https (this is not my host fault, actually, it's just yet another thing you need to buy) and the constant spam I got on the website. People would go to my link and find a totally different website trying to sell them something. That issue was not resolved either. 

There were other technical issues, from WordPress not functioning right due to database corruptions (the host had an automatic set up process), to my domain not being resolved correctly. In the past, such issues would die out in the first month or two when I switch to a new host -- but not this time. This time, as soon as I got the notification of renewal from PayPal, I immediately asked for cancellation. 

**** More Work to be Done

There's a lot more work to do on this website. I am still not happy with it, and I believe my WordPress blog overall looked better still. But it is up to me to make this place better with my own set of growing skills. CSS, ox-Hugo, Go, and of course, the quality (and quantity) what I write matter. 

I'm also not entirely happy with the blog hosted on GitHub, which is now owned by Microsoft. It's no difference than Tumblr being bought out by Yahoo. I need to move to an actual host with a more liberal point of view about sexual content. Unfortunately, in this world of ours, this means I'm looking for a host that is OK with Pornography. They have to include everything in one blanket statement so it's easy to sort out in courts, in case someone gets offended. But I'm not going to go down that hole right now, there's a whole lot of it, more than enough, on the internet right now with people freaking out about Tumblr. 

So what's the solution...? 

I believe AWS (Amazon hosting service) might be it for now. I find it hard to believe they'd bother chasing me if I mention a sexual encounter or show a picture of a breast. Still, even AWS is not a safe haven. Hmmm.

Even though it doesn't show on this blog (yet), I've been blogging since I got into college, more than a decade ago. Blogging is an activity that combines a couple of passions for me: writing, technology. and visual creativity. My process hasn't changed much over the years, and the tools I taught myself to use help me maintaining my routine. This is a quick explanation of its main components. 

#+hugo:more

**** Using the Journal

I usually create an event on my agenda and then write a journal entry about that specific event. This could mean several entries a day for different events, or on the other hand, only a few entries a month. This event-to-journal approach is helpful because it prevents me from writing too much at once and it keeps me focused. 

Pictures are another thing. I've created a script that automatically resizes and labels photos from my phone to streamline the process. Pictures are useful on two levels: first, it's a personal visual to decorate what I'm writing and makes it more memorable; second, the [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=undo+org-capture-kill&t=lm&ia=web][geolocation]] in the photo and the name of the file serves as a way for me to know where I've been specifically and at what time, very useful for a quick reality "bookmark" so I can refer to it later when I write. For example, I will take a picture of pies in a pie shop, and later I will title the post "2018-12-24, 16:04 @ Big Pie Shoppe," and the place name would be a link to Google Maps showing me that location.  

Because the journal contains personal things which are usually not immediately shareable or worth blogging about, I have a basic rule of thumb: I blog about experiences that happened at least a month ago. This allows some emotional distance from something I wrote about too impulsively in my journal and might want to reconsider. It also allows me to think of the event in question more like a story as I reflect on it. which makes the post more interesting to read. The idea is that if I have a good story to share, it can wait a month or even more and still be good.

**** Making an Outline

For me, making a basic outline is crucial. The outline is also a good tool to keep the post in a digestible length, something in the neighborhood of 500-700 words. An Outline is nothing more than a bunch of bullet points which I expand on as I write. I do write longer posts, but these are usually more of the technical, instruction-like texts. 

Another good thing about outlining is that it allows me to finish a post before I run out of "creative juice." I write for about 40 minutes (give or take), and when I feel I'm done, it's easy to get up and do something else. I return later to my draft to shape it into something worth reading, look for typos and grammar issues, and get it ready for posting.

[[file:static/drafting_a_post.png]] 

**** My Tools: Hugo and Org-mode

I started looking into [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] about three months ago as a replacement for WordPress. For non-programmers and people who are new to Git and GitHub (like I was), Hugo is not easy to pick up. I can't recommend Hugo to folks who just want to start writing; it's just too damn complicated. For me, as a techie and as a person on the lookout for a low-cost, reliable and secure solution, Hugo is excellent to learn and use. My website hosting is completely free, and the writing is integrated seamlessly into my journal, my calendar, and my tasks. It works well, but [[https://joshrollinswrites.com/blogging/hugo-beginnings/][it was /not/ easy to get there]].

Org-mode is a huge topic in itself which I've spent hours writing about in other places. Speaking from a blogging perspective, I use a "bridging" piece called [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][Ox-hugo]] which translates what I write in Org-mode to Hugo. If you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, here's a way to think of it: Hugo is the publishing platform (think of it as WordPress), and Org-mode is the writing tool (think of it as - shiver - Word or Google Docs). Ox-hugo is what copy-pastes from Word/Google Docs to WordPress, complete with links, formatting, headers, etc. 

These tools keep my writing easy and natural. What I write on my blog looks the same as what I write in my journal which looks the same as what's on my agenda. To me, that's one of the things that allows me to write much more frequently than ever before in a distraction-free environment. The complete opposite of MS Word, if you ask me.

It's time to get grumpy. Announcing a new category for tech news headlines and articles! 
 
   #+hugo: more

Today I read three different bad tech articles. This made me think, "hey, why not write posts about tech articles and explain /why/ they are not accurate? 

What does usually tick me off? Glad you asked. Mostly: 

  1. Anything Apple these days
  2. Aanything Google these days
  3. Quick panicky-like headlines we all know about or
  4. Quick panicky-like articles that tell you nothing new
  5. Quick panicky-like articles that give you stupid advice as a fix
  6. Basically, all Quick panicky-like things.

So, basically everything. 

Look folks, I'm far from being the final authority in telling you what's true or false. However, if I find something stupid to rant about online, it's usually because of experience with said something stupid.

You don't need to look hard to find the holes in this Emperor's clothes. Apple has been heading downhill for a couple of years, but it's only recently that the public at large started to take notice.  

#+hugo: more

Two good articles last week, one by [[https://www.wired.com/story/silver-lining-apples-very-bad-iphone-news/][Brian Barett]] in Wired and the other by [[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/technology/apple-iphone-replacement-mom.html][Kevin Roose]] in the NYT. Both explain the issue behind Apple's disappointing sales are closer to home than what Steve Cook would like us to think: consumers don't rush in to buy expensive new iPhones when their older ones are almost just as capable and work fine. " 'It used to be that for $650, you got all new features, a better screen, everything,” ' says one tech analyst in the Times' article. Now the phone costs at least $100 more (and the cost goes up easily since you need to buy parts and upgrades) for not much new. 

There's more going on than just smarter customers and humdrum technology from Apple, and you don't need to go digging to find the issue. Tim Cook is basically [[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/][saying]] it himself: Apple is a services company now. Tech pundits including famed [[https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning][John Gruber]] agree. 

But While Cook and Gruber believe in the "services first" future for Apple, the public is starting to digest the "hardware is second" present. Apple's hardware is mediocre at best, easily compare able with other leading tech company like Microsoft, Google, and Samsung. And, like these companies, Apple's products are prone to defects that are highlighted by Cook's more apologetic (and, I believe, increasingly frightened) reactions. The era of "You're holding it wrong" is over. 

Apple used to be untouchable in its innovative software /and/ hardware quality. Today, the remains of the glorious past is a hefty price tag.

When I was reaching my 30s, I hit a jackpot. I secured a deal for a rent-controlled apartment in Morningside Heights in Manhattan. I had a job that didn't quite pay the bills, even for that, so I drove almost 900 miles to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to fetch a friend whom I convinced to live with me in the city. 

The apartment had three bedrooms, a living room, a dining area, a small kitchen (which I loved a lot) and a shower. It was packed with old furniture and dusty chachkies because its owner was about 80 years old. He asked me to wire rent money to his account every month, left me with a key, and left for Florida. 

I've met, dated, and enjoyed many women during that period. I had professional dominatrix taking photos naked on my dinner table (I had to help them put on corsets), and I had a high school girl who I was afraid was underage (she wasn't) take a shower with me. I had a woman come over to have sex with both me and my friend-turned-roommate, and another who had an orgasm telling me I'm gay while penetrating me with her fingers. All remarkable, all faded out of my life as quickly as they came. 

A few years later, in a different apartment, I wasn't able to keep paying the rent. For the first time in decade, I had to move in with my mother, who moved to Manhattan by then. My mother's apartment had only one bedroom, a long hallway, and a living room. The kitchen was a corner carved out of the hallway and had strong fluorescent lights. I remember this because the lights and the noise of dishes woke me up every morning when my mother started making coffee a few inches away from the sofa on which I slept.

I've dated almost no one during that time. As a matter of fact, I can remember only two. That's because when I moved (with my mother) to another apartment, the relationships I started forming on top of the sofa with these two moved with it.  I graduated from the sofa to the bedroom. My mother, coincidentally, found a boyfriend in Pennsylvania and was away or most of the week. I noticed how slowly, with a stable job, better clothes, and the aforementioned status upgrade, I started dating more people again. Not as many - there wasn't much time and less energy - but it was a steady rising slope. The new people I've dated came and went. The job, also, quickly transformed into a new career. The two partners and the sofa remained.

It's funny how you think all you want is to be able to keep fucking everyone (figuratively and literally) but what you actually want is companionship. It's something we as a society keep shoving into everyone's throat, yet somehow, doesn't seem to stay in anyone's skull. Yet, it's the fear of being alone, completely alone, that we often afraid the most. I know because I'm an as introvert as they come, but even I have to admit that my life is a hollow shade of gray without the color these two relationships brought to my life. These connections shape us, make us who we are as adults, and eventually, these connections are also what is remembered when we are gone. there's nothing as painful as losing such a connection. 

You can't make a relationship out of thin air. That's because a relationship is forged from common experiences that you often try to avoid. Embarrassing little moments. Painful memories. The terrifying realization that at some point (you can't be sure when) caring about that person is more important than caring for yourself. Then, the peace that comes with accepting this realization. You can't find this sort of experience on Tinder, even if you pay their premium. 

I never wanted to end up on my mother's sofa, and to be honest, I never wanted to end up in relationships with both of my partners. But just like the sofa, shit happens. This is who I am now, and who they are, and how we came to be. My partners, who I affectionately call patches, live with me now. We often enjoy a good movie sitting on that sofa, which is with us still.  I'm older, I'm scarred, I have way less patience than I used to have, and I like it all just the way it is, good and bad, sofa or no sofa.

Last Saturday I had an encounter with dear ol' Aunt Dee. She's like a lifelong buddy of mine, never too far. She's a shy quiet wall flower, sneaks up on you, undetected.

I was playing another round of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities:_Skylines][Cities Skylines]], and realized I'm not much into the game anymore. As a matter of fact, I was forcing it for the last hour. I promised myself to go to gym, and a part of me was trying to use any possible excuse to keep me glued to that chair. It was gray and cold, it was a weekend after a hard week, I wasn't in the mood, I didn't eat enough, bla bla bla. I recognized this train of thoughts: "ah! I know you... you depression you, how have you been?" and checked my list. I think anyone who's been with dear aunt Dee for long enough has a similar list.

Sunday was different because I started it differently. The first thing I did was going back to my elements. This means, without getting all fancy about my life philosophy, that I did my morning exercise (few stretches, pull-ups, little weights) and meditation. I took my time before I set at the computer: first there was one round of exercise, then I made coffee, then a second round of exercise. Then there was meditation, which was a powerful mind-dump. I talked to myself about things that are important to me, things that I've neglected. Then the meditation itself, a series of deep breaths while counting. This is one of my life facts: when meditation is really needed, there's always strong resistance to it at start. By the end I don't want to finish it. Putting my mind on a state of neutral after emphasizing to myself things I care about is powerful. I'm far from being a meditation master and I don't read much on the matter, but this form of meditation always came naturally to me.

After that, Sunday started taking shape. I know so because my room started looking like my room again. First (it's always first) the bed. Then laundry. Then the closet, which was something I haven't dealt with in a while. Cleaning my room is similar to cleaning my head. It's odd, a made bed makes me feel so much better. I don't know why, but I don't argue, it works. Later on I went to gym again, this time without a long struggle. Later still, I enjoyed sharing a different video game, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn][The Return of the Obra Dinn]], with my partner. 

This time I didn't game as an exercise in solitude and forgetfulness. It was a mutual experience of puzzle solving. In retro respect, it reminds me of my grandparents playing bridge together, only with more high fives and laughs. There's something special about sharing something as intimate as a video game with someone who's been around long enough to share such an intimate thing with. Those of you who game know what I'm talking about: getting someone into your bed is not as nearly as intimate as having someone by your side while you play a video game, let along take an active part of it. My partners are the only people alive who can grab the mouse or the phone out of my hand mid-action and not encounter the scorning disdain on my face. 

Somewhere between the meditation, the game, the avocado salad/guacamole I've made, I found peace. Aunt Dee was gone, out of town, see-you-next-time. I've had a good day at work yesterday (not excellent, not awesome, just good). It's important that I mention it for myself, for next time, and for you, the other nephews of aunt Dee out there (or her relatives) who might find comfort in this.

Have a good rest of the week!

Last night I browsed Reddit, which is my much-adequate replacement for Facebook and the [[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/technology/google-plus-security-disclosure.html][now-officially-dead Google Plus]]. A post that captured my eye was "[[https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/9wozci/for_the_recordits_way_easier_to_get_a_date_with_a/][For the record—it’s way easier to get a date with a man than with a woman]]" in the Polyamory subreddit. 

I feel I can summarize the post in this statement the OP (original poster) made: 

"Ive been using several apps, some of which (like 'Her') are women-only. What I’ve come to discover is that most women are EXTREMELY passive on dating apps." She is a bisexual 29 year old female.  

My intension here is not to commet directly about the post itself (or the many comments under it it), but instead talk about my own experience as a CIS non-monogamous man nearing his 40s. 

**** Age

# The most difficult challange for me dating now than it used to be even 5 years ago is the age. Not my  age, but what age implies to the women I contact online. 

It seems that women who are living a healthy polyamorous lifestyle after 35 are extremly rare when compared to women in their 20s and even early 30s. Most women that I talk to are looking for something "serious" and "long lasting," which from their definition would mean a monogamous, long-term relationship that would at least lead in the direction of marriage. 

Even on Tinder, an app that is assumed to be more for hooking up and not for settling down, this pattern is very clear. Most women evaporate (they suddenly disapear from the app on my end altogether, which implies I'm being blocked) as soon as they understand I am a non-monogamist. This understanding comes, on Tinder at least, when they take the time to look at my profile (it's the first line) or when I explain it. We can sometimes have a converstion that extands to texts for a day or two, and then suddenly not a word when the understand of what the term means hits them. This last example is rare, but it happens; what important to note is that there's an extremly small portion of women who would carry on a conversation after what me (and other poly folks) call "drop the poly bomb". 

On OKCupid, the crowd generally is more careful with profiles. Even then though, women who would match up well with me (92% and above) would often describe non-monogamy as not something they personally appose to, but at the same time, not for them. OKC has altarted its dating filtering to cater better for non-monogamous folks a couple of times. There "seeing someone" relationship status for those who date openly has been around for a while. More recently, the site made the realtionship status stand out more, making it easier to find people who marked their profile as "non-monogmaous". Still though, the number of women who mark themselves as non-monogmous in NYC is fairely small in my age group. I am not sure how much my own profile filters some due to low percentage, but I doubnt the imapct is so large that only one profile in about 10 shows as non-monogamous. 


It's important to mention that I did not bother with all these details in the past. It seemed that women in general were much more willing to experiment, try new things, and date. Many times (but not always) this meant sexually. I think it's worth mentioning here that some of these women became friends even after we stopped dating romantically. I'm in touch with them to this day. If I am to guess (which is all I can do, this is my theory) I would say this has to do with what women (in general) are brought up to believe and, unfortuantely, "trained" for. Others still are looking for a "primary" partner who would treat them as the main anchor in the relationship and consider anyone else "seconadry." To me, this is not polyamory as much as it is a "reformed" monogamy of sorts. Many would appose, of course. To each their own. 

**** Priorities and Specifics

Another important aspect is diciplines of life at this point. For many, me including, work takes a large chunk of time. For the most part, I like it this way. I am passionate about my job and the passion often bleeds into my personal life. People who are passionate about what they do is important in dating. From my experience, when I date women who love what they do, it shows in everything.  

It so follows that women I want to date have similar priorities. In turn this leads to challanges, such as time managment, proximity (sometimes down to block radious in the city), certain amount of wealth, education and more. While I often feel I must be more flexible about my priorites, it seems the women I talk to do not. This is a simple case of supply and demand. I've talked to several women and I know that comparing my OKC inbox to theirs would be like comparing a flower in a pot in your living room to a meddow full vagitation, including the unwanted weed that grows everywhere. 

I have previously asked in the polyamory reddit for advice from women regarding how to reach to more of them. I was positively surprised at the amount of comments I recieved: most women who responded mentioned that the big issue is time and commitment. In other words, the fact that I'm busy with work and already have fulltime partners mean that I have little time for a new partner. That would be very true if the women I speak to would /know/ I have two full time partners and that I am very busy, but generally, they do not My profile specifies that I'm a non-monogmaous and generally busy, but I stay away from details until asked later. There's no reference to my partners and my relationship with them. This is not because I hide this information (I would gladly talk about it with a person I date), but because my partners have their own private lives as well, and my dating profile is not and should not be tied to them. 

However, In the past I used to connect to my partners' profile, and that made little to no difference. I found then that most women would not read as far into the profile to get to these details. They would just message me, curious about polyamory in general. I would often find myself in a position of explaining what it is and how it works. Times have changed.  

**** Mainstream

When I started dating as a non-monogamist, polyamory was a magical word. It was a term wispered at dark bars after a BDSM party died down, speaking of "another way" and a "lifestyle" that was never explained thoroughly. It would also be a term you would not dare mention for fear of being discovered at work and in the family. For some, this is still true, but the number is lowering every day.

We live in a different world now. Polyamory is a term that officially exists in dating apps and TV shows. The number of people who haven't heard of it before is decreasing fast. The good side of this is that we can talk about it, we can make it better, we don't need to be afraid of being judged and even have the power to take countermeasures if we are descriminated against. 

But the other part of going mainstream is the flatness. Polyamory is so common of a term now that it's being thrown around without care, and (in my opinion) without full understanding of what it means individually to each person. Where once you got the stage to discuss what polyamory means to you as a person over a drink with a facinated date, now you find that the person at the other side of the table, who sometimes never paracticed polyamory fully, already knows what polyamory is. Oh yes, they have a full definition, tied to judgment and a plan of action, just because you mention the word. You don't get to explain, they explain it /to you/. 

What is left is often to shake my head and turn my back. There's no talking to a wall, or a glass that is already full, as the famous zen saying goes. When I meet someone who flat out insist they don't  want to be a "unicorn" or a "secondary" or (worst of all) a cheating secret without the patience to listen, I just walk away. I tried to talk some sense into these people, but I stopped wasting my time. It never ends well. 

**** Attraction

Physical attraction is a big factor. I find it funny  how far we go out of our way sometimes not to mention this. It would seem we are so careful not to hurt anyone's feelings, and by doing so we hurt oursevles in the long run. 

The fact is, I don't find most of the women who are interested in me online attractive. There's hardly anything new or weird about this statement when you think about, yet, it just sounds so /bad/. Why is that? 

I do not think I have high standards. I am not attracted to obese women, though in some cases overwight is OK. I think [[http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight][WHO's BMI calculations]] is overall a pretty good guide for what I call overweight, if you're curious. I've tried to force myself to date obese and overwight women before and ended up being miserable, or made them misrable as a result. the temption, due to despair, can be overwhelming at times.

Other factors that go into attraction for me include less body hair in general, but I do not have any hard lines here. Smell and hygine are important to me. That's mostly it. It seems the women I date have far stricter requierments in this area, but I wouldn't know for sure. This is not often discussed as I hope it would,  even if I ask directly. My conclusion then is based on what I see on profiles, comments such as "please be fit," or "only groomed beards" and the like. Among the more hidden features (those are the kind that are not posted on the profile or discussed openely, sometimes never) the height issue seems to be a big deal: Most women want their partner to be taller than they are.

I've dated a tall woman once who, after a few months and a couple of sexual intercourses, finally came to the conclusion that the height differene /does/ in fact bothers her. She was somewhat surprised herself, it was a discovery she has made and shared with me. We have developed a friendship strong enough by then to respect one another to admit such things (we still are friends). She mentioned that the real realizion was not the fact that the height difference bothered her; it was the fact that she had /resisted/ acknologing it is such a big deal for so long. She saw herself as accepting and open minded, and having a problem with a height was betraying this image of herself. In other words, she wouldn't allow herself to admint she is not attracted to shorter men.

For calrification, I'm 5'6''. Definitely not the tallest out there, but there are many women my height or lower. This was never a real problem, I'm using it here as an example for a hidden feature as I explained earlier. 

**** Sex

Finally I want to address sex /means/. Most of us date with sex on the mind, to one degree or another. Of course there are asexual folks and those who use dating apps to create stirctly social connections, but in general this is rare. For a long time, I struggeld with the fact of bringing sex up on my profile. I have a somewhat of a BDSM background, and I'm not new to what is generally considered "kinky" sex. What this means, interestingly, is that I often bring sex up as a conversation topic. Because this is a personal and sensitive issue, I would ask a permission first, and naturally, I need to be comfortable myself. This doesn't usually happen on the first date, but it can. 

As an average CIS male (whatever average means), it seems I usually crave sex more often then those I date. However, it seems women crave sex just as much but are hold back from bringing it up. This ties to a familiar pattern of what wanting sex means to a woman, or, as a friend of mine would often say when I talk to her, what it still unfortunately means to women to "admit" wanting sex. I strongly agree that we still judge women who openly seek sex too harshly, but for now, this reality means most women won't be comfortable discussing sex opently before we get intimate, which in my opinion, is a disadventage. I should also mention that there are women who offer sex (or sexual connection) right off the bat, basically the equivilant of "dick pictures" just with female parts. In each case this happened to me, the woman is desperate and unattractive - physically or mentally.

When I was more involved in the "kink scene," sex was everywhere, and therefor, it was nowhere. Everyone had nude pictures on their profile and tell you what gets them off if you'd ask (with permission, of course). I found this libarating. I could know how someone would look like under their clothes and thus very simple to get laid if the interest was mutual. Interistingly though, usually there was /less/ of rush to get there.  You both knew what was down there, you both knew you want to get here eventually, so you both ended up getting a drink and talking it over and build something that would /include/ rather than lead to sex.  

Unfortnately I since stopped being as active. Partly due to time constraints, but mostly due to age. Many of these groups are strongly enfourced by an age limit that wouldn't allow a man my age to join a group of people in their 20s, for example. This is a good rule, and is there for a good reason. Work is often another thing that gets in the way, especially if you like what you do. It's just not as appealing to be an hour late and show up with a hangover to work. Been there, done that, no thank you kind of deal. 

In my opinion, Sex and its meaning is something we should definitely talk about more openly. If it's not on the table, which often means end of dating, so be it. If it is under certain understandings as it often is, it should be discussed. It is a topic that often disappears into a lingering question mark. Some like to call this a tease, but I don't. Teasing, I believe, is something that happens /after/ people are comfortable enough to put sex on the table. Otherwise, why waste feelings and time? Even at times where we're not sure sex will take place (this happens to me often enough), it is fine to say so. Something like "look, I don't want to get your hopes up, I'm just not sure yet. Can we take it easy one more time or two?" is perfectly fine. If it isn't, you'd better go look for someone else. I would. 

**** Where are we 

At this point in my life, dating people is at it's hardest. The only time in my life I recall dating being as challanging was my early 20s, where I was still a clueless virgin who tried to do everything "by the book." Life had different plans, as it often does, and I ended up the complete opposite direction which thankfully shocked me out of that stupid daze. 

I am a consitant person, and I belive in keeping on trying a forumla that generally works. This is what I intend to keep on doing. One of the things I know I should start doing again though is turning back to the kink scene and find positive people in it. That has been the best becon in the past, and I believe it could once again in the future.

The best way to explain what am I talking about, is a quick visual. 

# hello Vienmo??

If you haven't heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities:_Skylines][Cities Skylines]] before, the important thing to take from this video is that everything you see is located by the player (in this case, me). You can go as far deep as placing down each individual building and road down to the cracks in the aslphalt and the billboard signs if you want to. Some people [[https://i.redd.it/pta30b5n6lu11.png][go to that extent]] (you can see many amazing pictures like these in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines][game's reddit]]), but such realism requires more attention to details (and PC power) than I have. After all, some of these guys have been spending months, even /years/, into their cities. Yes you read it right, years. 

For me, the game is just the right mixture of visual beauty, attention to details, and peace of mind working on it. I can spend hours at a time into the night building parts of my city, listening to classic music. I emerge from my room after a long day at work smiling, humming to myself. 

Cities Skylines is a good example of why I keep playing video games, and what kind of games I keep getting back to.

When it was time to build a base on my second attempt at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnautica][Subnautica]], I picked a location near the [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Blood_Kelp_Zone][Blood Kelp Zone]]. Its cliff walls spread in front of me into the endless blue, and deep down I could see the pale [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Bloodvine][bloodvines]] reaching up toward me like the claws of a forgotten demon. As if by cue, scary dramatic music started playing, and my PDA's AI announced that the zone "matches 7 of the 9 preconditions for stimulating terror in humans." I was thankful the game creators didn't include the two other ones, whatever these may be.  

The reason I chose this location for my home was because of fear. Subnautica is a game about fear, and it was teaching me to face it one step at a time. The first time I played, the game had the element of surprise. I remember my first [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper_Leviathan][reaper]]: it came out of nowhere and grabbed my [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Seamoth][Seamoth]] like a plaything. I  yelped, slammed the Alt+F4 keys, and stomped out of my room white like the hallway wall I was leaning against, mumbling "oh my god" over and over. Now I know better. I know where they are, I can see them in the distance, and... I'm still scared. But I go ahead anyway. The fear is not pushing me away; it's teaching me to be prepared. The only thing that's really scary is fear itself.

Now, the base is furnished complete with a [[http://subnautica.wikia.com/wiki/Moonpool][Moonpool]] for my Seamoth which I call "Discovery." It is powered by a nuclear reactor I built from fractions retrieved from brave explorations. A single glass corridor connects my living area to a bubble-like observatory room which hovers directly over the dark abyss. There's a chair in the middle of that observatory, so I can sit and read my PDA's contents while staring fear in the face. 

I've found something at the bottom of the abyss. "Something that shouldn't be there." It's a dark, green-hellish looking place with bones of creatures the size of an apartment building. Each day I explore further. Each day I push further and the game never fails to scare me. Winning these small battles against myself bit by bit becomes addictive. I look back at what scared me before and I know I've conquered it. I know that now if one of these monsters chooses to attack my base, I will fight it. The base hanging over the cliff that once terrorized me is now my home, transformed into my new comfort zone. I know every fold in the ground, every floaters-covered rock, every hole to the mushroom cave. You can't be scared of what you know. Subnautica is an excellent teacher of this lesson.
