20:39. My iWatch rings. Bigger boss is on the line. I know what it is and my instinct not to answer is there, but I reach for my phone and call back anyway. He asks if I solved the issue and if I contacted the rest of the team. I say I didn't; that is, didn't try further than I did at work - stayed almost an hour extra, informed everyone via emails and our messaging app. He asks that I call my co-workers and see if there's information about resetting the server on our work wiki. He knows how, but it's our job. It's our server.

I sit in my chair for a second before I remote in. My palms spread, fingertips touching each other, thumbs slightly rubbing my forehead, eyes closed. I'm a bit scared of doing this because I haven't done this before. Not like this. Not completely on my own, and not at this place. I go ahead and remote into my work computer.

My tech instinct, which I can't fully explain sometimes, tells me to look for the remote server administration tools. I never use the server tools directly, I usually just use print management, or AD tools, or group policy tools directly. But this time I need to reset a printing server, so somehow I know I need this tool. I figure out the print server name from the print management tool, easy enough. I see I have no servers listed, but I'm calm. I know that's because I never used this tool before, not because I can't connect to the server. I figure out how to search for servers on the domain, and within a second, I find the server and try to log in. It authenticates, allows me in.

So, I'm supposed to be here. The knowledge that the responsibility for this server is suddenly mine hits me. I just made it so by logging in. I right click on the server from a dropdown list, and there it is. the option to restart the server. Chill.

I call Bigger Boss again to confirm this is the right server to restart. We have hundreds of computers, and I need confirmation. He gives the go-ahead, so I click. A few seconds pass while I'm looking up more information, but I can't find it. It's OK, there are limits to learning your job after 9 PM. The server looks like it restarted, so I remote into one of the machines I had the problem with earlier and try to print. This time it looks like it worked. It seems like the problem is resolved. 100 or so doctors-to-be who couldn't print forms for their patients can now print again. Did I just do that? Thanks to my tech instincts,  maybe, but more importantly, because I picked up. That was the real decision that I  made; the rest was natural.

This sets me apart from what I used to be only a few weeks ago. I'm on call. I live in the backyard of my job. Bigger boss knows he can trust me because I'm there. It comes with the responsibility of being the "mom" of the team, I feel, and I don't like that part. But here I am. I ask myself, is it all because of the raise? And I answer myself: no. The reason I got the raise was because I was already appreciated. Because I pushed myself to say something. Because I got frustrated. Because I care. I care. That's why I picked up the phone. Not for Bigger Boss or the job as much as I care to fix something I believe I can fix. I'm a fixer, and this is what I do.
