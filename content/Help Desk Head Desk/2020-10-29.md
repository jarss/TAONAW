It took me some time to write my  [previous post about privacy](https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/2020-10-07/). It took twice as long to publish this one. The methods below are not illegal, yet, as you read through them, you might get the feeling they might be. One of the questions that may rise would probably be "but why would I go to such extremes?"
