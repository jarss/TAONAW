I have a habit chaining in org-mode for this blog which shows me I'm passed due on updating. 4 days, to be exact. I'm rushing to update with this little post as I'm sitting here gulping coffee in my boxers before a shower I need to take... so bear with me.

I've been working on a post about photography for over a week. It proved to be challenging to put together because every time I put it back on my screen, there are updates and more things I want to talk about. Over the past month, there were a few good points I discussed with different people which I wanted to include, and I just don't seem to have the time, which is the excuse I hate the most. Usually, it just means you need a slightly different angle to think of things.

So I've been reconsidering and I'd like to work on a video again, recording some of my thoughts. After all, part of getting the camera was recording videos and getting better at these -- not to mention that I can use visual examples. So I hope to get to that even tonight.

In the meantime, I just wanted to update and tell you all I'm still here, still alive and kicking, just behind. Thanks for sticking around!
