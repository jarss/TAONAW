To really get back to the basics, we need to go beyond org-mode and into Emacs. And in order to get into Emacs, we need to talk a bit about Linux. And in order to talk about Linux, we need to talk about the philosophy of Linux. This is a whole lot to discuss, and I won't even scratch the surface of anything, really. What I'm going to discuss here is _my_ purely non-objective opinions that lead me down this path.

Think of your productivity as a spear. The spear of productivity. The whole spear is Linux. Emacs then is the spearhead. At the tip, the sharpest point, is org-mode, the tool of tools:

## The Spear: Linux {#the-spear-linux}

Linux, like the speark, is lean and sable. You can lean on it for your work. As a person who uses macOS, Windows and Linux on a daily basis, my experience is that only Linux is predictable and stable (Windows is the worse offender) but also minimal and customizable (macOS is generally harder to customize).

This is important because your productivity starts with your environment: a clean desktop, no extra notifiction popping at you from all direction, and the ability to change how it looks and acts exactly the way you want it. I use [KDE's plasma desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE%5FPlasma%5F5), which is the most popular today for Linux. It "borrows" tools from macOS and Windows (macOS' hot corners + Window's start menu, for example).

My path into Linux precedes my quest into Emacs org-mode by a few good years, and I'm happy it did. I can't imagine emacs in another enviornment, though for some folks, it works well inside macOS (I haven't heard from anyone who actually _likes_ emacs in Windows - they set it up with it because they have to).

Without getting into the deep technical here just yet, here are some of the features I appriciate about Linux for my productivity environment:

-   Minimal interface with applications that offer as little "fluff" as possible
-   Once you download an app and use it, it's yours:
    -   No forced updates that will break it (macOS Catalina)
    -   No payments and subscriptions (Office 365, Adobe)
-   When you learn and use the command line, the workflow is the same for decades
-   Plays well with other systems, Windows or macOS. Opposite is not as true.
-   Set it and forget it: scripts to automate your workflow will work for years.
-   Cheap: you can afford the best tools and can learn to use them.


## Spearhead: Emacs {#spearhead-emacs}

In the past, I used to consider my non-coding background as a disadvantage when slow sank into Emacs. But code can be learned. Philosophy needs to be discovered.

Emacs is

-   If Linux is the prodcutivity environemnt, Emacs is the swiss-knife for everything almost done in it.

-   Org-mode is what pulled me to Emacs, the tip of the spear of Emacs.
