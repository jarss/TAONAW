Orignally, I started writing about keeping a journal in org-mode and why it works so well. Realizing I mentioned my method serveral times previously, the post became repetitive and somewhat boring. I didn't really get into the why and how on journaling and surrounded the topic with technical details instead.

I've had a journal (though infrequently earlier on) since my early 20s. I call it a journal and not a diary, because the definition for me is changing from writing on different topics to writing specifically for the purpose of recording events on a regular basis. This thick notebook of mine from then has a table of contents on its two first pages with a list of dates. This is not different from what I have now, in org-mode.

Unfortunately, life has been to chaotic (both around me and in my own head) to keep at it uninterruped. I'm not sure at what point I started converting to digital form, but I filrted with a digital journal for years before it became a my primery method some eight years ago or so. The reason for this was a blog that I started, and the journal served as a launch pad of ideas to expand on publically.

Interestingly, it's the old paper journals that survived and moved with me (for the most part) while the digital ones are lost somewhere in their digital form. I've tried so many different applications, and my thoughts are spread across Google, Microsoft Evernote and Apple products, some defunked and cannot be restored. My journal today, in org-mode, is resistant to that (at least, that's my hope) and is one of the reasons I enjoy keeping a journal here, on the same platform i use for blogging and to organize my day. It is a powerful tool and it's completely _free_ waiting to be owned by whomever start using it -- but I'm getting ahead of myself.


## Transition to Digital Form {#transition-to-digital-form}

I'm not sure when I transitioned to digital journaling, but I believe it was tied into having my own comptuer with me. Digital journaling offers a couple of benefits over hand-written ones:

1.  I can read my own notes: my hand writing is horrible. English and latin letters are not what I grew up writing (even though, even my early journals in my native language are not exactly neat, and I'm being generous) sos much so that when I wanted to go back and read what I wrote, I just couldn't. Combined with spelling mistakes I've had early on, sometimes it's just an impossible mess. Digital forms fixes this issue.[^fn:1]

2.  Can write more: this is because of a couple of things. First, I have more room to write and I don't struggle with turning paper around and fitting sentenses into corners (I know some people don't have this problem to begin with). Second, my hand would get tired especially as I get more emotional sometimes and press hard on the paper. I tried to control the pressure and it somewhat worked, but it required mental effort that took away from writing my thoughts down. Finally, I can write faster typing than by hand. I can closely match up with someone who speaks in a lecture form, for example, and that's fast enough for my thoughts.

3.  Organization and storage: this is a bit of a contradiction, since I said earlier I lost my earlier digital journals. This is now fixed though. Digital notes are more organized (I save mine by week number in a year) and can quickly be used with images, something I had difficulty in written form. I started to print out images and glue into my notebooks, but this only happned after I was writing digitally and got used to having images in my journal pages. This didn't occur to me previously. As for storage, my journal now is saved in several locations and can be restored in case this is needed; the same is not true for my physical journals which can get damaged and are, over time.


## Paper? {#paper}

To be fair, there are a couple of things I miss back in my paper journals. The thing I probably miss the most in paper journals is that they are 100% personal. The choice of notebook, the way it ages and shows daily usage, the handwriting, cards and stickies shoved between the pages -- things you can actually touch and smell -- there are irreplaceable in a digital format.

For their birthday, I got my partner (who loves scribbling down their thoughts) a pack of limited-edition [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/limited-editions) with a couple of parker pens. I was skeptical of the small size of these things and their simplicity, but they are thrilled with it. They write vertically and horizontally, add tables for their plans, and the fact that you need magnifying glass to see some of the side notes only makes the whole thing look better. It's a small pack of pure personality that reflects my partner perfectly. I on the other hand, a methodological creature by nature, used graph-paper notebooks for as long as I can remember because I needed my littel tiny boxes even then. I used to align pictures with the blue guide lines when I pasted them in. Nothing speaks of your personality as a paper journal.

I miss having something personal and _un_-technological in my life, especially as an IT professional. There are many aspects I can expand this way (and I do), but I just like writing. Sometimes I just miss the feeling of the pen, and I have the itch to just sketch something quickly, without opening a dedicated program and having a specific goal in mind.


## How does it look like {#how-does-it-look-like}

**Notes**

[^fn:1]: - Many digital writing forms come with spell-checking option which can be highly distracting. This is a habit that I believe started with Word's red zigzag which force you to stop your train of throught and focus on the mistakes. Emcas org-mode does not have this problem: Spell-checking takes place only after you highlited a sagment of your writing and ask for it. This means spell-cheking is _seperate_ from the writing proccess, which is important. I didn't realize how distrubing this cane be before transitioning to org-mode.
