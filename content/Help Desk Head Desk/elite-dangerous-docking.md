In other [MMOGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively%5Fmultiplayer%5Fonline%5Fgame), you see them as soon as you log in. The annoying jumping-strafe-lean dance that happens in any [PUBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayerUnknown%2527s%5FBattlegrounds) like game. Skill  is measured in how well you can jump to duge bullets, how well you can manipulate game physics, and just generally trains you to be an asshole toward other people. The experience of playing with a bunch of 10-year-olds hits you in the face like a cold shower as soon as I log in, generally keeping me away from trying any MMOGs. Elite Dangerous has an execellent defence mechanism against such [griefers](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=griefer): docking.

Docking your ship in Elite is where the jump-strafe asshats lose their patience.
