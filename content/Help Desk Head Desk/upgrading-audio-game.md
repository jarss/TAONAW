After a few months of on-and-of research and saving some money aside, I finally upgraded my Audio system on my PC to something worthy of a audiophile-wannabe. As it turns out, it wasn't as expensive as I feared.

## The Source: FLAC Files and Re-Discovering Music {#the-source-flac-files-and-re-discovering-music}

As a teenager, I was first introduced to sound on a computer with [Sound Blaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound%5FBlaster) back in the 90s in the first [Prince of Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince%5Fof%5FPersia%5F(1989%5Fvideo%5Fgame)) game. Until that moment, I was not aware computers could produce better sounds than 8-bit beeps. Music, up to that point, was either somewhat of low quality on the radio or high quality through a stero system which my dad owned at the time.

this experience made me believe that if I want to be serious, I shouldn't start my journy by looking at better headsets. As [one of my favorite bloggers](https://www.rousette.org.uk/) (and self identifiying- audiophile) BSIAG wrote to me in an email: "the best way is to start with improving the source, and work your way towards the output (speakers or headphones)."

The first step was easy enough to follow: start using lossless [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) files instead of MP3s and other lossy-compressed formats that are usually availble on popular streaming services. But, if the popular streaming services (like Spotify, Apple Music and Google Music) do not provide lossless audio, where do you get the good stuff?

The Library. Armed with my card, I ordered a couple of CDs from the online catalog to be dlievered to my local branch. I picked up a few CDs, and after a quick research settled on [ABCDE](https://abcde.einval.com/wiki/) (that's "A Better CD Encouder". Catchy, eh?) to rip the CDs into FLAC format. It did a fine job, [connecting to CDDB to find artists names and downloading album art as well](http://www.andrews-corner.org/linux/abcde/abcde%5Flossless.html). I repeated the proccess for a few classical CDs, exploring different sounds. I also tried a few CDs I already owned and learned an important lesson: many modern CDs are already created flat and primed for loudness, so that using FLAC format did not really matter. In other words, if you listen to Marlyn Manson's beatiful people on a streaming service or a CD, there's virtually no difference in the richness of the sound. That's because that reachness is present in the varation of different volume levels of parts of the track. For example, the artist's breathing, their finger sliding on the strings, certain bass sounds etc have different level volumes which makes the track more whole and "mutli-dimensional" where a proccessed recording often flattens it out and increases the important bits for you, drowning the other sounds out. This is why, perhaps, some people swear by live recordings where this proccessing is mostly absent.

I'm also lucky to have a sound engineer in the family who loves and works with local indie artists. When I told him about my quest toward better music plan and asked him for advice, he quickly suggested [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/).

Bandcamp is a site that pays artists directly and much more than streaming serivies do. At the same time it keeps this digital works in FLAC format for download. You pay for a CD, usually as much as you want, and the Music is yours to save on your computer with the artist's thanks and blessing. Bandcamp remembers what CDs you bought and slowly suggests new artits and people who follow them for more music. For the last month or so I found myself doing something I haven't done since I was a teenager: buying albums. My growing collection already includes 10 digital albums that make want to come back home and do nothing more than sit in my chair, close my eyes, and listen to music.


## Equipment: DACs, AMPs, and Getting my Headset {#equipment-dacs-amps-and-getting-my-headset}

Another thing BSIAG did for me is to solidify the concept of a DAC ([Digital to Audio Converter](https://www.whathifi.com/advice/dacs-everything-you-need-to-know)). Until that point, I knew there's this "box" serious music lovers and sound engineers seem to connect their ultra-expensive headset to at their computers. As it turns out, there's a whole world of technology behind DACs and AMPs.

I can't go deep into it here because I have only basic understanding of it myself, but the general idea is that DACs convert the digital information (think 1s and 0s) in your computer to analog (wave-like, the stuff we can actually hear) information. All modern computers and phones come with a built in DACs (which is why you can just plug in a pair of earphones directly into your iPhone, for example), but these are very basic. an AMP (or simply an amplifier) is a device that amplifies certain signals - in our case, sound signals. Why would you need all this volume pushing into your head? Isn't it a bad idea?

Well, as it turns out, high-quality headphones _resist_ the electrical current more than cheap ones. I'm not sure about the exact sciense behing this, but it's measured in impedance. Better (and usually more expensive) headphones = higher resistance (impedance) = more power (stronger AMP). There's much more to this than I'm explaning here. take a look at this [YouTune video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDbh7yDVFL8) that explains some (but not all) of these concepts.

By the time I was ready to buy the DAC and the headphones, my partner got a job offer from a professional audio store in mid-town Manhattan, [Audio46](https://audio46.com/). I've heard good things about this place from the same guy who told me about bandcamp, and now that that came with a lunch date, I had to check it out myself. I don't want to just blast them with priases (obvioulsy I'm not objective) but a few things are important to note. First, they didn't move a dollar beyond the budget I specified. These things are expensive, and as a person who's only entering this world of sound I'm probably a good target for folks to get me to buy expensive equipment I may or may not need. Not here. Second, I was able to choose and try on several headphones with my own music before committing to anything, and let me tell you, I took my time. Their patience and ability to gracesly work with other customers while still checking on is a different experience than you get in Best Buy for sure. Third, the knowledge. Some of the things I explained above were completely alien to me before I walked into this store. It wasn't just a shopping experience, it was a learning experience as well.

I ended up buying the basic but popular [FIIO Q1](https://audio46.com/products/fiio-q1-mark-ii-native-dsd-dac-amp-headphone-amplifier-for-iphone-ipod-ipad) for a DAC, which works on my phone just as well as it works on my computer, and a pair of the [Beyerdynamic DT-880](https://audio46.com/products/beyerdynamic-dt-880-600-ohm-premium-headphones). Because I'm starting out, I wanted something that would also work on my phone when I'm traveling or want to listen to music on the go and not just at home. This defenitely qualifies.


## Source (Bandcamp) {#source--bandcamp}

But getting hifi good indie music on the cheap is not the only benefit of the site. As I started using it more and more, I discovered it has a daily and a weekly newsletter (on the site itself) with new and listen-worthy artists. As you learn which artists you like more, you can get more similar music from artists that follow and recomment the artist you like. This resulted in some great music I would have never dicovered from streaming services, which seem to always repeate a select few "seed" songs that create random play lists (not to mention, the streaming music on these sites is of lower quality, usually 128kbs MP3s).
