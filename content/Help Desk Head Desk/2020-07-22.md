Those of you who subscribe to this blog via RSS (if you don't, you [should](https://joshrollinswrites.com/index.xml)) should now be able to read full content in RSS.

<!--more-->

Hugo [comes with a default RSS](https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/#the-embedded-rss-xml) [template](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/%5Fdefault/rss.xml) that generates RSS for you out of the box. You can create an RSS template in your site's `/layout/_default/` directory. Create rss.xml and use your own code, or if you're like me and just want to change something quick, use the template above and copy-paste the contents from git-hub.

To allow full posts on the RSS feed (default is only the summaries, the bits you see on the main blog page), change the "Summary" default to "Content" toward the end, in this line: `<description>{{ .Summary | html }}</description>`. This is a nice tip I discovered at [GODO.DEV](https://www.godo.dev/tutorials/hugo-full-text-rss/).

~~Next, need to add RSS link at the sidebar for anyone else interested and doesn't know about the blog's RSS.~~ This is now done, though rather ugly. Some CSS work and possibly include other links as well.
