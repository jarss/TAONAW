Over the time I've been using org-mode, a natural process of project management has emerged. For the first time in my adult life, I haven't felt the need to switch systems of productivity. I even enjoy looking at my projects nowadays, a list of organized notes, tasks, and information. I've discussed projects here before, but not in this detail. I hope this would be beneficial to others, especially those new to org-mode.

This system is rather simple and straight forward, without many bells and whistles. To understand it though, I need to first discuss my methodology in org-mode.

Most tasks are created in one of two ways: through a capture template on my desktop (either at home or at work), or through a tap on the "+" on my [Orgzly widget](http://www.orgzly.com/help) on my phone. I've discussed both of these a couple of times on my blog under the [org-mode tag](https://joshrollinswrites.com/tags/orgmode/).

A task is usually nothing more than a quick reminder ("pick up clothes from the dry cleaner"). Sometimes, especially at work, a task can become more complex: ("Create a consistent guest user-template on office iMac") which then develops sub-tasks ("Auto-launch Safari: ticket creation page") and ("log user out within 5 minutes of inactivity") and ("Keep same wallpaper for all guest log-ins").

When this happens, my method is to switch the first task's [Keyword](https://orgmode.org/manual/Workflow-states.html#Workflow-states) (which is now the parent task) from `TODO` to `ACTIVE`  and remove the "Scheduled" property. Then, I create a sub-task under it ("Auto-launch Safari: ticket creation page") and _that_ sub-tasks gets its own "Scheduled" property.

Here's how it looks like laid out:

You'd notice I use agenda-visible timestamps to express the duration of the project as I work on it. This also means that the project will show at the top of my agenda&nbsp;[^fn:1], so I see my in-progress big projects first. When all sub-tasks are done for the projects, I mark the parent task as DONE and move on.

large projects, ones that can end up taking weeks and months, are too big to fit in my [weekly org file](https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20200123/). Thankfully I don't have too many such projects&nbsp;[^fn:2]. When such a large project takes place, I do two additional things. First, I create an independent org file for the project. Second, I create a "Log" sub-tree at the very top of the project, before all the other TODOs, which is used as a journal for that project. The log sub-tree is broken down by non-agenda timestamps and brief titles, explaining my thoughts and methods as I work through the project. I also take a second look at the title of the project, which is often just the very first task that started it, and change it to "OP: ..." something. I find that calling a large project something like "OP: iMac walk-ins terminator" instead of "Create a consistent guest user-template on office iMac" is more memorable and just plain fun.

While I have an active journal file, I find that more and more I gravitate toward breaking off journal "chunks" into respective projects I'm working on. This is faster (my thoughts about the project are right there, not in a separate journal that needs to be linked correctly) and easier to retrieve later (instead of thinking "what was it that I did..." staring at a large journal thinking what to search for, I have a project with related thoughts).

I don't have a clear-cut requirement of switching from multi-level tasks to a full project, nor a point where I switch from writing in my generic journal to starting a log in a specific project, but I'd say it's a mix of how much time I've worked on something (is it been a few weeks? Do I keep getting back to it?) and how complex it is.


## Footnotes: {#footnotes}

[^fn:1]: This is done with `(setq org-sort-agenda-notime-is-late nil)`.
[^fn:2]: This is more a state of mind than a technical limitation. I don't like having large projects weighing down on my agenda because these often get stuck as I wait on other people and little progress is made. If I'm absolutely sure I need to have such a project up (for example, if we're working on a large-scale migration at work), I try to adjust the timestamps on my agenda so I don't see the project all the time and rather have a sub-task as a reminder to check in on something again. I find that it's often better mentally to have a clear agenda, knowing that I have a task set to check-in on something within 24 or 48 hours than to constantly see all my TODOs stuck in red at the top.
