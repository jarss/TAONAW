Uhm! Urm... testing, testing, 1 2...3?

Can you guys here me over there?

I'm writing this from ScarFace, in a basement of a house in Oregon, far from my native NYC on a vacation. It is 7AM, and I've been up since around 5 tinkering this laptop to work with Hugo.

Makes me think I underestimate myself. I write frustrated toots on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.technology/@jrss/100752549890521270)
