This website is virtually free to maintain[^fn:1].

TAONAW is created with [Hugo Go](https://gohugo.io/), a free open-source site generator. It is designed and authored on a free Linux OS using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) and [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/).  Bandwidth is currently supplied free of charge by Github.

I write posts in my free time because I want to and I enjoy doing so. No one is supporting me, sponsoring me, or otherwise paying me anything to write or create or publish any content. The goal is to keep things this way.

As a token of appreciation, I do take one-time [tips](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=%5Fs-xclick&hosted%5Fbutton%5Fid=XBBGQRR2CX5EJ&source=url). I am also planning on selling some of my [photos](https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/20200201/) in the future.


## **Footnotes** {#footnotes}

[^fn:1]: The domain, joshrollinswrites.com, costs me about $15 and change with per year.
