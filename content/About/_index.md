Josh Rollins is an NYC based self-made-techie who works with humans and machines and enjoys interacting with both. He explores automation, privacy, and affordability in tech, and most of the time finds himself tangled in the blurred lines between the real and the ideal.

Rollins has broken his technology - this website included - many times over. While he sees himself disqualified to give any _good_ advice, he enjoys doing so just the same. With whatever spare time he has left, Rollins tries to upgrade himself and lead a semi-healthy somewhat sane lifestyle.

As an individual who shuns Facebook and Twitter, Rollins can be a bit tricky to find these days, but he can be reached at jarss at protonmail dot com, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/JR121), or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.technology/web/accounts/115656).
