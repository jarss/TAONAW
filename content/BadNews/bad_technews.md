OK bad tech news, it's time to get grumpy. Announcing a new category for stupid teach news headlines and articles!

<!--more-->

I guess I'm staying true to my grumpy whiny tech guy persona. Today I found not one, not two, but three tech articles I have issues with. This made me think, hey, why not write posts about crappy tech articles and explain _why_ they're crappy?

What usually ticks me off? Glad you asked:

1.  Usually anything Apple these days
2.  Usually anything Google these days
3.  Quick panicky-like headlines we all know about or
4.  Quick panicky-like articles that tell you nothing new
5.  Quick panicky-like articles that give you stupid advice as a fix
6.  Basically, all Quick panicky-like things.

So, basically everything.

Look folks, I'm far from being the final authority in telling you what's true or false. However, if I find something stupid to rant about online, it's usually because of experience with said something stupid.
