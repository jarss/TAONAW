The best way to explain what am I talking about, is a quick visual.

If you haven't heard of [Cities Skylines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities:%5FSkylines) before, the important thing to take from this video is that everything you see is located by the player (in this case, me). You can go as far deep as placing down each individual building and road down to the cracks in the aslphalt and the billboard signs if you want to. Some people [go to that extent](https://i.redd.it/pta30b5n6lu11.png) (you can see many amazing pictures like these in the [game's reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines)), but such realism requires more attention to details (and PC power) than I have. After all, some of these guys have been spending months, even _years_, into their cities. Yes you read it right, years.

For me, the game is just the right mixture of visual beauty, attention to details, and peace of mind working on it. I can spend hours at a time into the night building parts of my city, listening to classic music. I emerge from my room after a long day at work smiling, humming to myself.

Cities Skylines is a good example of why I keep playing video games, and what kind of games I keep getting back to.
