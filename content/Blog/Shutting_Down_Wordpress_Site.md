Got an email from PayPal saying my host just charged me for $80 bucks and change for another year of service. Withing 30 seconds I was already cancelling the subscription. Hugo, this blog, has been working 10 times better off of Github than my previous website ever did. There were always issues with the site, which kept going off line several tiems a month.

AWS on Amazon chargest me a dollar every month for hosting for an experimental wiki and my glacier account of around 10GB or so. A buck, and I can have my blog hosted there for as little as 12 dollars a year -- and it will be much faster, https including, and will probably never be down.

So that's it folks, I guess I'm sold on the Hugo idea. It wasn't easy, and this blog is still somewhat limping, but it is a solid place for my thoughts.
